This package provides a major mode to work with [[https://github.com/ilkka-torma/diddy/][Diddy]], a /"Python toolbox for analysis of infinite discrete dynamical systems"/ written by Ilkka TÃ¶rma and Ville Salo.

* Usage & Configuration
** Features

*Remark:* Some features are implemented by using a rather automatic translation from Diddy's internal parser. The command names might therefore not be up-to-date, and the docstring are not necessarily very informative.

- Minimal completion of Diddy command names (commands starting with a ~%~)
- Minimal documentation of those commands (in the modeline, after a valid command name, there should be some docstring telling you what options and flags this command expects.)
- Syntactic highlighting
- Easy compilation of the current file (see below)
- A decent integration with Emacs other tools: in particular, if you are used to e.g. some completion mechanism or some custom compilation procedure, this should work correctly with =diddy-mode=.

** Run

The main interactive function provided by the package is =diddy-run-file=. This
creates a command-line command which runs the Diddy program on the current file.
By default, this is bound to =C-c C-c=.

You will have to modify some variables to have a functioning compilation command, as you need to make =diddy-mode= aware of where Diddy is actually installed on your computer.

You can also use the function =diddy-browse-examples= to be asked for a file in Diddy's examples directory.

** Customizations

Some customizables variables:

- =diddy-python= Path to the Python interpreter. Diddy needs at least Python 3.9 (default value: ="python3.9"=).
- =diddy-path= Path to the ~diddy.py~ file (default value: ="~/diddy/diddy.py"=).
- =diddy-confirm-compile= Whether you need to confirm the compilation command built using the previous variables (default value: =compilation-read-command=, which is by default =t=).
- =diddy-save-before-compile= Whether to save automatically if the current file has been modified before compiling (default value: =t=).
