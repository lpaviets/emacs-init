* Organization of this file

This file contains the entirety of my Emacs configuration, written in a Org Mode
document that gets tangled to a single =init.el= file. It was largely based on
[[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/][Emacs From Scratch]] originally, but has somewhat evolved past it.

Because I use a version system on those files, I don't mind conflicts with the
currently loaded configuration file, and so the the generated file is actually
called =init.el=. By default, Emacs reads (and loads) file such as "~/.emacs" or
"~/.emacs.d/init.el" at startup, so the output of =org-babel-tangle= is
automatically replacing the previous configuration file. If you want to avoid
those conflicts, you might need to rename it, and manually replace your current
=init.el= with whatever file has been produced by tangling this configuration
file.

To modify the name of the output, you can change it in the second line of this
document, after the =:tangle= keyword. Note that neither this file not the tangled
file are hardcoded in the Elisp code, and I use =user-emacs-directory= everywhere
where one might expect an hardcoded location. Indeed, you might want to have
your configuration in a different location than =~/.emacs.d=, and as such, nothing
is immediately broken !

Some commands have to be run manually whenever the generated =init.el= file is
loaded for the first time, but they are always highlighted: whenever this is the
case, the particular situation is explicitly signaled by the presence of the
*MANUAL* keyword in front of those commands, and the necessary steps to ensure
that everything is working as intended are detailed afterwards.

If the =init.el= file cannot be properly loaded at startup, try to search for
such keywords in this file and execute the corresponding commands.

* Initialization
** Lexical Binding

This is quite a complex topic. More info on the Emacs side can be found [[info:elisp#Lexical Binding][here]],
and more generally [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope_vs._dynamic_scope][on Wikipedia]]. This could arguably be the default. Modern code
should work fine with it, and code that /doesn't/ work with lexical binding,
expecting dynamic binding everywhere, should be refactored.

#+NAME: lexical-binding
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb yes
  <<lexical-binding>>
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el" :noweb yes
  <<lexical-binding>>
#+end_src

** Emacs performance

First, we set things up so that Emacs starts /fast/ (and also with the frame
maximized)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  (set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen 'maximized)
  (setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000) ; 1e8 = 100 MB (default: 800kB)
#+end_src

Another thing that might be of interest is to know how long it took for Emacs to
start. Although there is already a built-in function to do this (try to call
=emacs-init-time= in any Emacs session), we want it to be automatically
displayed anytime we start Emacs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  (defun lps/display-startup-time ()
    (message "Emacs started in %s seconds"
             (format "%.2f"
                     (float-time
                      (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time)))))

  (defun lps/display-garbage-collection ()
    (message "Emacs performed %d garbage collection"
             gcs-done))

  (defun lps/restore-gc-cons ()
    ;; After startup, we restore gc-cons-threshold to a more reasonable value
    (setq gc-cons-threshold 10000000)) ; 1e7 = 10 MB

  (setq read-process-output-max (* 8 1024 1024)) ;; 2mb

  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'lps/display-startup-time)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'lps/display-garbage-collection)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'lps/restore-gc-cons)

#+end_src

In order to speed-up the startup, we also make a few more tweaks:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  ;; This avoids a lot of regexp matches between filenames and
  ;; this large list of handlers.
  ;; TODO: make sure this does not break with TRAMP and desktop-read ?
  (defvar file-name-handler-alist-old file-name-handler-alist)

  (setq file-name-handler-alist nil)

  (add-hook 'after-init-hook
            (lambda ()
              (setq file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist-old)))
#+end_src

** Configuration management
*** Packages

Then, we need to configure how we will install packages. We use another package
manager that the default one: =use-package=.

It makes both installation and customization easier, and the code is also
simpler to read.

The first thing we do is check for a CLI argument, telling us that we should
only use builtin packages; this might be useful to start Emacs in a "nice" state
for us, e.g. during a fresh install or when debugging, while not loading any
packages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  (defvar lps/only-built-in-p nil
    "Variable indicating if we can load, or even download, packages
  that are not built-in.

  Should be non-nil to only allow built-in packages.")

  (when (member "--only-built-in" command-line-args)
    (message "Using only built-in packages")
    (setq command-line-args (delete "--only-built-in" command-line-args))
    (setq lps/only-built-in-p t))
#+end_src

We now setup the built-in package manager, adding some online repositories to
its available sources, and some personal extra packages that are too big to fit
within this configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Initialize package sources
  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                           ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                           ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                           ("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/")))

  (package-initialize)

  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents t))       ; Async

  (setq package-native-compile t)

  ;; Initialize use-package on non-Linux platforms
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  ;; Symlink (or directly place) your personal packages in this
  ;; directory. Simple way to add personal packages Need to use
  ;; `update-file-autoloads' or `update-directory-autoloads' in this dir
  ;; and regularly and place the autoloads in the
  ;; personal-<private-shared>autoloads.el file
  ;; TODO: fix this with new autoloads as of version 29 !

  ;; (let* ((extra-package-dir (expand-file-name "extra-packages"
  ;;                                             user-emacs-directory))
  ;;        (extra-package-dir-shared (expand-file-name "shared" extra-package-dir))
  ;;        (extra-package-dir-private (expand-file-name "private" extra-package-dir))
  ;;        (extra-autoloads (list (expand-file-name "personal-private-autoloads.el"
  ;;                                                 extra-package-dir-private)
  ;;                               (expand-file-name "personal-shared-autoloads.el"
  ;;                                                 extra-package-dir-shared))))
  ;;   (add-to-list 'load-path extra-package-dir-shared)
  ;;   (add-to-list 'load-path extra-package-dir-private)
  ;;   (dolist (file extra-autoloads)
  ;;     (when (file-exists-p file)
  ;;       (load file))))


  (defun lps/reinstall-package (pkg)
    (interactive (list (intern (completing-read "Reinstall package: "
                                                (mapcar #'car package-alist)))))
    (ignore-errors
      (unload-feature pkg t))
    (package-reinstall pkg)
    (require pkg))
#+end_src

*MANUAL* You might want to configure =use-package= differently, as it is the
tool used everywhere else in this configuration file to install and setup other
packages. For example, the line =(setq use-package-always-ensure t)= is used to
install all the packages mentioned in this file automatically if you do not
already have them. Depending on your environment, you might want to consider
another, more appropriate behaviour (/e.g./ if you lack space, time, if you use
another OS, if you are already compiling some of those packages by yourself, and
so on).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  (require 'use-package)
  (use-package use-package
    :custom
    (use-package-keywords (add-to-list 'use-package-keywords :only-built-in))
    (use-package-defaults (add-to-list 'use-package-defaults
                                       '(:only-built-in ''absent t)
                                       nil 'equal))
    ;; Comment this line if you don't want to automatically install
    ;; all the packages that you are missing
    (use-package-always-ensure nil)
    ;; Uncomment the folllowing line to have a detailed startup log
    ;; (use-package-verbose t)
    ;; (use-package-compute-statistics t)
    ;; (use-package-always-defer t)
    :config
    (defun use-package-normalize/:only-built-in (_name-symbol keyword args)
      (use-package-only-one (symbol-name keyword) args
        #'use-package-normalize-value))

    ;; We could use the function `package-built-in-p'
    ;;
    ;; However, we might not want to load /all/ the built-in packages in
    ;; a "debug"/fresh install session, and reciprocally, we might have
    ;; some local features/packages configured with `use-package' that
    ;; are not built-in, although their code is already
    ;; present/tested/whatever.
    (defun use-package-handler/:only-built-in (name _keyword arg rest state)
      (let ((body (use-package-process-keywords name rest state)))
        `((when (or (not lps/only-built-in-p)
                    (eq ,arg t)
                    (and (eq ',name 'emacs)
                         (eq ,arg 'absent)))
            ,@body)))))
#+end_src

In order to benchmark the package loading, we use [[https://github.com/dholm/benchmark-init-el][benchmark-init.el]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package benchmark-init
    :disabled t
    :config
    ;; To disable collection of benchmark data after init is done.
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'benchmark-init/deactivate))
#+end_src

Because we will customize bindings, functions and so on, some variables are
defined there so they are available in the following sections of this file.

*** Some macros and utilities

Although ~use-package~ is extensible and we could add some keywords to it, it is
rather cumbersome and I prefer to define personal macros to deal with various
operating systems and versions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  (defmacro system-case (&rest cases)
    "Light wrapper around `cl-case' on `system-type'"

      (symbol (if (eq version t)

*** Personal keymaps

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil

    (defvar lps/quick-edit-map (make-sparse-keymap))

#+end_src

We finally add a few bindings to manage our packages more efficiently.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package package
    :ensure nil
    :bind
    (:map lps/system-tools-map
          ("P i" . package-install)
          ("P l" . package-list-packages)
          ("P d" . package-delete)
          ("P u" . package-update)))
#+end_src

** Security and privacy

Emacs is not very secure as such. We try to fix this as best as we can.

We explicitly fix how long passwords should be cached. A clever thing could be
to distinguish between different environments, and use different values for
/e.g./ the computer you use at work vs other computers. Another idea could be to
ask the user if he wants his password to be cached for the current session, and
if so, for how long.

*MANUAL* In order to allow GPG passwords to be asked in the minibuffer, you need
to add the line =allow-emacs-pinentry= to your =gpg-agent.conf= file, usually
located in the =~/.gnupg/= directory on Linux.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (system-case
   (gnu/linux
    (use-package password-cache
      :defer t
      :custom
      (password-cache t)
      (password-cache-expiry 300))

    (use-package pinentry
      :defer t
      ;; Apparently no longer needed in recent GPG/Emacs versions
      :disabled t
      :after epa
      :custom
      (epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback)
      ;; Try to delay after epa ?
      ;; :init
      ;; (add-hook-once 'find-file-hook 'pinentry-start)
      :config
      (pinentry-start))

    (use-package auth-source
      :defer t
      :custom
      (auth-sources '("secrets:default"
                      ;; "~/.authinfo.gpg" ; try not to use it, see if anything breaks
                      ))
      (auth-source-cache-expiry 86400) ;; All day

      :config
      (defvar lps/auth-cache-expiry-setup-p t) ; change it to ask for duration on startup

      (defun lps/auth-source-define-cache-expiry ()
        (interactive)
        (unless lps/auth-cache-expiry-setup-p
          (setq lps/auth-cache-expiry-setup-p t)
          (when (y-or-n-p (concat "Change default auth-cache-expiry value "
                                  "(default "
                                  (number-to-string auth-source-cache-expiry)
                                  ") ?"))
            (setq auth-source-cache-expiry
                  (read-number "New cache expiry value in seconds: " auth-source-cache-expiry)))))

      (defun lps/force-forget-all-passwords ()
        (interactive)
        (auth-source-forget-all-cached)
        (shell-command "gpgconf --kill gpg-agent")
        ;; (shell-command "gpgconf -- reload gpg-agent")
        (setq lps/auth-cache-expiry-setup-p nil)))))
#+end_src

Now, for some other privacy-related settings: even with some basic security
stuff (e.g., no password in plaintext being written in the init files), some
packages still depend on "soft" private informations (mail addresses, for
example, or nicknames in the case of IRC). Those might be synchronized between
machines using external means, but we still need to configure them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    (defvar lps/extra-packages-private-dir
      (locate-user-emacs-file "extra-packages/private/"))

    (defun lps/find-in-private-dir (file)
      (expand-file-name file lps/extra-packages-private-dir)))
#+end_src

** Quick restart

In order to test things more rapidly and to be able to apply configuration
changes without ever leaving Emacs, we also install another package to restart
Emacs with a simple command.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ensure-emacs-version 29
    (use-package emacs
      :bind
      (:map lps/system-tools-map
            ("r" . restart-emacs))))
#+end_src

** Saving the session

Emacs is generally meant to be started once and stay up for long period of
times. Even when using "emacs server" with =emacs --daemon= and emacsclient,
although you can quickly create emacs frames and frequently quit them, the
actual server is a long-running process. Nevertheless, you sometimes have to
close it for whatever reason, and at those times it is nice if you can
immediately start working from where you were the last time you quitted Emacs !

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package desktop
    :init
    ;; Only use desktop-save-mode automatically in daemon mode
    ;; Otherwise, just manually restore/save stuff
    (add-hook-once 'server-after-make-frame-hook
                   (lambda ()
                     (let ((desktop-load-locked-desktop t))
                       (desktop-save-mode 1)
                       (desktop-read (car desktop-path)))))
    ;; (desktop-save-mode 1)
    :custom
    (desktop-path (list (locate-user-emacs-file "desktop-saves/")))

       (t t))))
#+end_src

We can also remember more information than "which files were opened"; the
built-in ~save-place-mode~ remembers /where/ your point was the list time you
opened a file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package saveplace
    :ensure nil
    :defer t
    :custom
    (save-place-file (locate-user-emacs-file ".saveplaces"))
    (save-place-limit 1000)               ; better be safe
    :init
    (add-hook-once 'find-file-hook (lambda ()
                                     (save-place-mode 1)
                                     (save-place-find-file-hook))))
#+end_src

** Server mode and emacsclient

For various reasons, we might want to use Emacs in "server-mode": although it is
not completely correct, the idea is that we start a daemon running "the real
Emacs process" as a server, and we will simply connect clients to it to work
with. There are small differences with the way Emacs normally works, so we deal
with them in this section.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package server
    :custom
    (server-client-instructions nil))
#+end_src

** Custom file

We do not want Emacs to mess with our own =init.el= file, and so we tell it
where to store all its precious customizations

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :custom
    (custom-file (locate-user-emacs-file "custom-file.el"))
    :config
    (load custom-file 'noerror))
#+end_src

** Byte- and native compilation

In this section, we configure how Emacs byte-compiles and/or natively compiles
the source code of packages that we install.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ensure-emacs-version 28
   (use-package emacs
     :custom
     (native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors 'silent)))
#+end_src

* UI Configuration
** Font and encoding
*** Encoding and input

Even if most of the time, you should be working with UTF-8, we still want to
make sure that this is the default and that Emacs assumes that we are using
UTF-8

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :custom
    (locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (display-raw-bytes-as-hex t)
    (default-transient-input-method "rfc1345") ; see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1345
    :init
    (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-language-environment 'utf-8)
    (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
    (set-clipboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-file-name-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8))
#+end_src

Finally, as I am mostly using a French, AZERTY keyboard, some combinations are
hard to input, /e.g./ everything of the form =C-^= or =M-~=. Indeed, those are
dead keys, and cannot really be pressed at the same time than a modifier key.
Hence, we simply "remap" (using translation maps, see the [[info:elisp#Translation Keymaps][manual]] !)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "<C-dead-circumflex>") (kbd "C-^"))
    (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "<M-dead-circumflex>") (kbd "M-^"))
    :bind
    (:map lps/quick-edit-map
          ("C-z" . iso-transl-ctl-x-8-map)))
#+end_src

*** Fonts and faces

In this section, we configure the default fonts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    ;; Use the right font according to what is installed on the system
    (defvar lps/default-font
      (system-case
       (gnu/linux "DejaVu Sans Mono")))

    (defvar lps/fixed-font
      (system-case
       (gnu/linux "DejaVu Sans Mono")))

    (defvar lps/variable-font
      (system-case
       (gnu/linux "Cantarell")))

    (defun lps/set-default-fonts ()
      ;; Variable pitch
      (let ((all-fonts (font-family-list))
            (font-assoc `((variable-pitch ,lps/variable-font)
                          (fixed-pitch ,lps/fixed-font)
                          (default ,lps/default-font))))
        (dolist (new-font font-assoc)
          (let ((font-name (car new-font))
                (font-val (cadr new-font)))
            (when (member font-val all-fonts)
              (set-face-attribute font-name nil :family font-val))))))

    (if (daemonp)
        (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions
                  (lambda (frame)
                    (with-selected-frame frame
                      (lps/set-default-fonts))))
      (lps/set-default-fonts)))
#+end_src

We also add some icons, to make things prettier !
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  (use-package nerd-icons
    ;; Why is it needed ? Shouldn't it be called automatically ?
    ;; Anyway, I need that for Emacs to automatically use the right font
    ;; for this Unicode codepoints ...
    :init
    ;; TODO: clarify which one is needed ?
    (defun lps/setup-nerd-fonts ()
      (when (display-graphic-p)
        (nerd-icons-set-font)))

    (if (daemonp)
        (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook 'lps/setup-nerd-fonts)
      (add-hook-once 'post-command-hook 'lps/setup-nerd-fonts)))
#+end_src

Finally, we define a few functions to deal with faces in the rest of the
configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    (defun lps/remove-face-property (val)
      (remove-text-properties 0 (length val) '(face nil) val)
      val))
#+end_src

** Visual interface changes

We remove all the unnecessary elements from the interface, /e.g./ menus, scroll
bar and so on.

You can remove or partially modify this block of code if you are a beginner and
want to keep some of elements available, especially to be able to navigate with
the mouse.

All the variable names are pretty explicit, so you should be able to customize
this to your taste easily.

*** Startup

Who wants to be told the same thing over and over again each time they start
Emacs ? We add here some customizations both for convenience, and faster
startup.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :tangle "early-init.el"
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t
        ;; Hack to speedup startup, but have easy mode change !
        initial-scratch-message ";; (lisp-interaction-mode)\n;; (org-mode)\n\n"
        initial-major-mode 'fundamental-mode)
  ;; Emacs frame startup
  <<fullscreen-alpha>>

  ;; Bell
  <<bell>>

  ;; Menus
  <<menus>>
#+end_src

However, we would like to see Emacs in full-screen if we are to use it

#+NAME: fullscreen-alpha
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  ;; Maximize the Emacs frame at startup
  (dolist (prop '((fullscreen . maximized)
                  ;; (visibility . nil)
                  ))
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist prop nil 'equal))

  (when (version<= "29" emacs-version)
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha-background . 95))
    (set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 95))

  ;; (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'make-frame-visible)
#+end_src

We also don't want Emacs to be flashing and beeping at us whenver we do
something wrong. Be quiet, please, error /messages/ are fine without VFX on top
of them !

#+NAME: bell
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
  (setq visible-bell nil)
#+end_src

*** Menus and toolbars

Emacs is very much keyboard-oriented. As such, we have little-to-no use of the
various menus, toolbars and scrollbars that Emacs provides.

#+NAME: menus
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  ;; Doom inspired: don't call the functions directly
  (push '(menu-bar-lines . 0)   default-frame-alist)
  (push '(tool-bar-lines . 0)   default-frame-alist)
  (push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)

  (setq scroll-bar-mode nil
        tool-bar-mode nil
        menu-bar-mode nil)

  (tooltip-mode -1)
  (set-fringe-mode 10)
#+end_src

*** Lines and columns

Because we now have plenty of free space on our screen, we can sacrifice a bit
of it to put useful information there, such as line numbers. We also want to see
the current line and column in the modeline, and while we are at it, we also
want Emacs to wrap our lines in modes where this makes sense, so that we never
have to scroll horizontally to see the end of a long line (besides, how would we
do it, now that we don't have a scrollbar anymore ?!)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    (column-number-mode t)

    (setq-default word-wrap t)
    (toggle-word-wrap 1)

    (defun lps/activate-truncate-lines ()

                                            tabulated-list-mode-hook
                                            occur-mode-hook)
      "Modes in which `truncate-lines' will be set to `t' automatically")

    (dolist (hook lps/truncate-lines-modes-hook)
      (add-hook hook 'lps/activate-truncate-lines))

    (defun lps/enable-auto-hscroll-scroll ()
      (setq-local auto-hscroll-mode t))

    (define-fringe-bitmap 'lps/continuation-left

#+end_src

*** Theme

This is simply a way to change how Emacs looks. Some themes are more complete
than other (they will modify how other packages look, like Magit, or even the
minibuffer)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
  ;; Themes

    (kaolin-themes-hl-line-colored t)
    (kaolin-themes-org-scale-headings nil))
#+end_src

*** Presentation

As we tend to use ~beamer~ to make presentations (and therefore, the slides are
in fact a PDF file), we wish to use Emacs as a nice viewer /for slideshows/.
This includes hiding as much of the UI as possible, using full screen, and so
on.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Extra packages

Some packages are used lated in the configuration, and we want to be able to use
those comfortable modes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package beacon
    :init
    (add-hook-once 'post-command-hook 'beacon-mode)
    :custom
    (beacon-blink-when-point-moves-vertically 30)
    (beacon-size 20))

  (use-package rainbow-mode
    :hook (org-mode . rainbow-mode))

  (use-package highlight-numbers
    :hook ((prog-mode LaTeX-mode) . highlight-numbers-mode))
#+end_src

Another built-in and useful package that often comes up is =hl-line=. When
enabled, it simply highlights the current line (/i.e./ the one on which the
point is). When dealing with tables, or "rigidly organized" data, it is often
useful to be able to quickly tell what is on which line.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package hl-line
    :only-built-in t
    :hook ((tabulated-list-mode
            ibuffer-mode
            dired-mode
            proced-mode)
           . hl-line-mode))
#+end_src

Another useful thing, which is not strictly necessary but comfortable when
working, is to have visual hints for words like "TODO", "FIXME" and the likes.
Indeed, it is likely that if you use them in a text file or source code, there
is something that you definitely /don't/ want to forget or miss !

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package hl-todo
    :init
    (add-hook-once 'find-file-hook 'global-hl-todo-mode)
    :bind
    (:map hl-todo-mode-map
          ("C-c t p" . hl-todo-previous)
          ("C-c t n" . hl-todo-next)
          ("C-c t o" . hl-todo-occur)
          ("C-c t i" . hl-todo-insert))
    :custom
    (hl-todo-include-modes '(prog-mode text-mode))
    (hl-todo-color-background t)
    (hl-todo-wrap-movement t)
    (hl-todo-highlight-punctuation ":!.?")
    (hl-todo-keyword-faces `(("TODO" . "#cc9393")
                             ("FAIL" . "#8c5353")
                             ("DONE" . "#afd8af")
                             ("HACK" . "#d0bf8f")
                             ("FIXME" . "#cc9393")))
    :config
    (defvar hl-todo-repeat-map
      (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
        (define-key map (kbd "n") #'hl-todo-next)
        (define-key map (kbd "p") #'hl-todo-previous)
        (define-key map (kbd "i") #'hl-todo-insert)
        map))
    (dolist (cmd '(hl-todo-next hl-todo-previous hl-todo-insert))
      (put cmd 'repeat-map 'hl-todo-repeat-map)))
#+end_src

** Whitespaces

First of all, we never want ~TAB~ to insert actual tab characters. We also don't
like trailing whitespaces, so we delete them automatically when we save a
buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :hook (before-save . delete-trailing-whitespace)
    :init
    ;; Tab behaviour and whitespaces
    (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
    (setq-default tab-width 8) ; otherwise, Emacs source code is ugly ...
    :custom
    (cycle-spacing-actions '(just-one-space
                             (delete-all-space inverted-arg)
                             delete-all-space
                             restore))
    :bind
    (:map lps/quick-edit-map
          ("DEL" . cycle-spacing)
          ("<C-backspace>" . join-line)
          ("<C-S-backspace>" . join-next-line))
    :config
    (defun join-next-line (&optional beg end)
      (interactive
       (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only)
              (and (use-region-p)
                   (list (region-beginning) (region-end)))))
      (join-line t beg end)))
#+end_src

Finally, as Emacs also has commands to work with pages (as opposed to paragraphs
and so on), we improve the visual look of those pages breaks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package page-break-lines
    :hook (emacs-news-mode . page-break-lines-mode))
#+end_src

** Hydra

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] is a package that is used to group several related commands into a family
of bindings, all starting with the same prefix (= "hydra"). Whenever this common
prefix is entered in a suitable mode, a panel shows up, showing all the
user-defined commands that can now be invoked with a single keystroke instead of
repeatedly using the same long prefix.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package hydra
    :defer t)
#+end_src

All the hydras will now be defined after the package to which they correspond,
or in the appropriate section. Most of them are modifications of hydras that can
be found on the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki][hydra wiki]].

Some hydras will be called less frequently and for other purposes than getting a
"quick-and-dirty" access to commonly used functions. Hence, we will make them
prettier (the compromise being that they are less minimalistic and take much
more space visually)

*MANUAL* This is not a MELPA package. It can be found [[https://github.com/Ladicle/hydra-posframe][here]]. Install it and
change the loading path according to your configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Easier hydra definition
  (use-package pretty-hydra
    :after hydra)
#+end_src

** Interactively change the UI

This is one moment where a pretty hydra could help us change general UI
parameters, such as the text size, some highlighting options and so on.

** Minibuffer
*** Generic tweaks
First of all, some configuration to make all the minibuffer sessions more
pleasant, regardless of the completion or narrowing system used.

We also add a few functions to change or improve completions, independently from
the actual "completion framework" used.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :custom
    (enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
    (completions-group t)
    :config
    (minibuffer-depth-indicate-mode 1)

    (defun lps/disable-minibuffer-completion-help (fun &rest args)
      (cl-letf (((symbol-function #'minibuffer-completion-help)
                 #'ignore))
        (apply fun args)))

    (defun lps/completing-read-in-region (start end collection &optional predicate)
      "Prompt for completion of region in the minibuffer if non-unique.
     Use as a value for `completion-in-region-function'.

  It might be buggy with some backend, so use at your own risk"
      (let* ((initial (buffer-substring-no-properties start end))
             (all (completion-all-completions initial collection predicate
                                              (length initial)))
             (completion (cond
                          ((atom all) nil)
                          ((and (consp all) (atom (cdr all))) (car all))
                          (t (completing-read
                              "Completion: " collection predicate nil initial)))))
        (cond (completion (completion--replace start end completion) t)
              (t (message "No completion") nil))))

    (defmacro lps/with-completing-read-in-region (&rest body)
      (declare (indent 1))
      `(let ((completion-in-region-function 'lps/completing-read-in-region))

*** Vertico/Marginalia
~ivy~ is a fantastic addition to Emacs, and it makes interacting with Emacs much
more comfortable, be it for invoking commands or looking for function
documentation, or quickly interacting with files without having to use a Dired
buffer. However, it is /bloated/, and can feel slow at times. Moreover, if you
only really use some of its functionalities, it can feel a bit overwhelming, and
not worth the trouble of configuring everything.

For this reason, we might want to take a look at some lightweight alternatives,
built on top of the default completion/narrowing tools that Emacs provide,
instead of using ~ivy~ or ~helm~ which use their own massive framework.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package icomplete
    :ensure nil
    :when lps/only-built-in-p
    :only-built-in t
    :custom

    (icomplete-compute-delay 0.05)
    :config
    (icomplete-vertical-mode 1))

  (use-package vertico
    :custom
    (vertico-cycle t)
    :init
    (add-hook-once 'pre-command-hook 'vertico-mode)
    :bind
    (:map vertico-map
          ("<C-backspace>" . lps/minibuffer-go-up-directory))
    :config
    (defun lps/minibuffer-go-up-directory (arg)
      (interactive "p")
      (let* ((filename (minibuffer-contents))
             (directory-maybe (file-name-directory filename))
             (directory (if (and (string-suffix-p "/" filename)
                                 (equal filename directory-maybe))
                            (file-name-directory (substring filename 0 -1))
                          directory-maybe)))
        (if directory
            (progn
              (delete-minibuffer-contents)
              (insert directory))
          (backward-kill-word arg)))))
#+end_src

Emacs uses metadata to differentiate between several types of things for
completion. For example, when using ~find-file~, Emacs attachs to each
suggestion a bit of data to tell that they are actually files.

In order to add more information of this kind to those suggestions, and to
interact with it more naturally, we use another package which integrates very
well with ~vertico~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package marginalia
    :demand t
    :after vertico
    :bind
    (:map minibuffer-local-map

      "Annotate function CAND with its documentation string."
      (when-let (sym (intern-soft cand))

          (marginalia--fields
           (:left (marginalia-annotate-binding cand))
           ((marginalia--symbol-class sym) :face 'marginalia-type)
           ((marginalia--function-args sym) :face 'marginalia-value
            :truncate 0.8)
           ((marginalia--function-doc sym)
            :truncate 1.0 :face 'marginalia-documentation)
           ((abbreviate-file-name (or (symbol-file sym) ""))
            :truncate -0.5 :face 'marginalia-file-name)))))

** Buffer and windows

Sometimes, we also want some very specific buffer to be associated to a certain
window. As there is probably no general rule that would decide this for us, it
is not possible to modify ~display-buffer-alist~ or other similar variables to
get the desired behaviour. Hence, we will simply create a function that binds -
or unbinds - the current buffer to the current window.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  buffer in current window."

           (set-window-dedicated-p window (not (window-dedicated-p window))))
         "%s: Can't touch this!"
       "%s is up for grabs.")
     (current-buffer)))
#+end_src

** Files
Although /buffers/ are what Emacs really manipulates, they are in particular
often used to deal with ... files. Hence, we need ways to do things specifically
for buffer that are visiting files, and also related to file management in
general.

A first thing that we do here is load some utilities:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'xdg)
#+end_src

*** Open file

We often want to visit links. If the point is on a file path, for example, it is
often useful to be able to quicky navigate to this file.

*** Rename and delete file
Dired (or even your prefered shell) is the prefered way to deal with large
amount of file manipulation (mass copying, moving and so on). For one-time
actions though, it is preferable to have quick ways to rename a file, rather
than having to open a Dired buffer, look for the specific file we are visiting,
and so.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Backup and auto-save
By default, Emacs performs a lot of backups, allowing to recover both from
unwanted modifications (/e.g./ modifying a file, saving it, and realizing later
that you have overriden something important) or unexpected crashes. However, the
way those files are handled is somewhat intrusive.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :only-built-in t
    :custom
    (backup-by-copying t)
    :init
    (defvar lps/backup-directory (locate-user-emacs-file".backups/"))
    (unless (file-exists-p lps/backup-directory)
      (make-directory lps/backup-directory))

    (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,lps/backup-directory)))

    (defun lps/disable-auto-save-mode ()
      (auto-save-mode -1)))
#+end_src

*** Temporary files
Emacs mainly works with /buffers/, but some programs and tools require things to
be written to /files/. Sometimes, you only care about the content itself, and
don't want the file to actually persist on disk: this is were temporary files
come to the rescue ! Emacs already offers convenience functions to create, save
and work with temp files; we only make some wrappers around them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :bind
    (:map ctl-x-x-map
          ("s" . lps/save-as-temp-file))
    :init
    (defun lps/save-as-temp-file ()
      "Save the current buffer to a temporary file.

  If the buffer name is NAME.EXT (where EXT is optional), the
  resulting temporary file will use NAME as a prefix and EXT as an
  extension.

  The code is not very robust, and more or less assumes that the
  buffer name already resembles a file name"
      (interactive)
      (let* ((name (buffer-name))
             (ext (file-name-extension name))
             (name-sans (file-name-base name)))
        (write-file (make-temp-file (or name-sans "")
                                    nil
                                    (and ext (concat "." ext)))))))
#+end_src

** Outline and folding
Sometimes, when documents get bigger and bigger, it is useful to be able to
temporarily hide stuff. The built-in ~narrow-to-\*~ commands can be useful to
really focus on a part of the document, but we might want to be able to get a
rough outline of the /whole/ document at any time, but in a less cluttered way.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package outline
    :ensure nil
    :defer t
    :hook (prog-mode . outline-minor-mode)
    :custom
    (outline-minor-mode-prefix (kbd "M-o"))
    :config
    ;; Problems with TAB -> completely override cycle keymap
    (setq outline-mode-cycle-map (make-sparse-keymap)))
#+end_src

** Mouse and scrolling

There are (obviously) many variables and functions controlling how scrolling
works: amount of scroll, position of the point after a scroll, horizontal &
vertical scrolls, and so on. We use the keyboard even for scrolling, so we want
to have the nicest possible experience for this. On the other hand, sometimes,
the mouse wheel can still be pretty convenient, so it's good to have a way to
customize its behaviour too.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :custom
    (scroll-preserve-screen-position t)
    (scroll-error-top-bottom t)
    (mouse-wheel-tilt-scroll t)
    :config
    (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook
              (lambda ()
                (unless (display-graphic-p)
                  (xterm-mouse-mode)))))
#+end_src

** XWidget

You can compile emacs with XWidget support to be able to visualize many things
in a pretty way (/e.g./ HTML files or mails, render markdown ...). For this, you
need to build Emacs with the =--with-xwidgets= flag.

NOTE: YOu might need to call =export WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0= for it to work.

** Help !
*** Improve default help
Emacs already has a /great/ documentation system, but it is still possible to
improve it ! [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful]] makes things easier to remember and to use without having
to search for documentation in multiple places.

It will condense all the available information about something within a single
Help buffer, and will add some documentation to the commands you are currently
typing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

We can also improve some of the other help commands:

    ;; Minor improvements to visual appearance:

    (defun lps/man-search-option ()
      "Search for a specific option in a man page.

      (interactive)

             (completion-ignore-case t)
             (chosen (completing-read "Search in section: " Man--sections

#+end_src

*** Info-mode

Another useful built-in tool to read documentation is ~info-mode~. This is
convenient major-mode used to read =.info= files, a GNU file format mainly used
to write technical documentation; several GNU (and non-GNU) utilities and
softwares have an Info manual, readable using this mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package info
    :bind
    (:map Info-mode-map
          ("S" . consult-info))
    :hook
    (Info-mode . olivetti-mode)
    :config
    (add-to-list 'Info-additional-directory-list
                 "/usr/share/texmf-dist/doc/info/")

    (let* ((site-lisp "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/")
           (infos-files (directory-files-recursively site-lisp "\\.info$"))
           (infos-dirs (mapcar 'file-name-directory infos-files)))
      (dolist (info infos-dirs)
        (add-to-list 'Info-additional-directory-list info nil 'equal))))

  ;;; Add some colours to Info nodes
  (use-package info-colors
    :hook (Info-selection . info-colors-fontify-node)
    :config
    ;; Just to see better lisp code block
    (set-face-attribute 'info-colors-lisp-code-block nil :weight 'bold))
#+end_src

We also use a minor mode which renames info buffers into clearer names, rather
than having =*info*= for every info page !

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package info-rename-buffer
    :defer t
    :hook
    (Info-mode . info-rename-buffer-mode))
#+end_src

*** Which-key

Because there are a lot of similar commands, it is quite easy to get lost.
[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a package that shows all the available commands after having typed
some prefix, meaning that knowing the beginning of a key sequence is enough to
get the rest of the information.

For example, if you press =C-c=, then a panel will appear at the bottom of the
screen to show how you can currently continue this command, depending on which
buffer you are in.


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; which-key. Shows all the available key sequences after a prefix
  (use-package which-key
    :defer t
    :init
    (add-hook-once 'pre-command-hook 'which-key-mode)
    :custom
    (which-key-idle-delay 1)
    (which-key-idle-secondary-delay 0.05)
    :config
    (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom))
#+end_src

*** Help at point

By default, whenever you place your /mouse/ cursor over something - say, a
hyperlink -, Emacs will display a help message in the echo area. However, we
tend not to use the mouse at all, and in particular having to use the mouse for
help would feel a little bit "backwards" compared to Emacs' general philosophy.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package help-at-pt
    :only-built-in t
    :ensure nil
    :custom
    (help-at-pt-display-when-idle t)
    (help-at-pt-timer-delay 0.5))
#+end_src

We also add a way to use the mouse for help, with a typical menu appearing when
you right-click on something. Of course, when using a keyboard, there are
usually more powerful (even contextual) tools, but this is sometimes good
enough.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    (ensure-emacs-version "28.1"
      (add-hook-once 'pre-command-hook 'context-menu-mode)))
#+end_src

* Commands
** Disabled commands

We want to use the full Emacs power. However, if you find yourself using
repeatedly a dangerous command by mistake, you might want to disable it

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Don't disable any command
  ;; BE CAREFUL
  ;; If you are a new user, you might to comment out this line
  (setq disabled-command-function nil)

#+end_src

** History
*** Prescient

There is a way to go even faster for completion. Indeed, when in doubt, why not
suggest recent or popular completions ? That is exactly what ~prescient~ does,
by sorting the suggestions according to their frequency or how recently we used
them.

This goes beyond commands, but can also be used for any kind of documentation
lookup, with =describe-function= or =describe-variable= for example.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Generic Prescient configuration
  (use-package prescient
    :custom
    (prescient-history-length 50)
    (prescient-sort-length-enable nil)
    :hook (company-mode . prescient-persist-mode))
#+end_src

~prescient~ can also be used with completion frameworks such as ~company~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-prescient
    :after company
    :hook (company-mode . company-prescient-mode))
#+end_src

*** Other solutions

Another lighter and built-in solution is the simpler package ~savehist~. If you
want to use a lighter Emacs version, or if for some reason you want to stay "as
close to the original Emacs", this is a perfectly fine solution, and its major
drawback is that it does not work for "in-buffer" auto-completions (although it
might be possible with a lot of tuning ?)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package savehist
    :ensure nil
    :only-built-in t
    :defer t
    :init
    (add-hook-once 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda ()
                                            (savehist-mode 1)
                                            (savehist-minibuffer-hook))))
#+end_src

** Keycast

I used to use a mode called =command-log-mode= to show in real time the keys
that I was pressing and the commands that were executed (to demonstrate what
Emacs can do,to make it easier for newcomers to follow what's happening, and so
on). As of now, I consider =keycast= to simply be a better alternative.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package keycast
    :defer t

** Utilities
~consult~ provides a lot of useful commands that can be used during a minibuffer
session to act on the selection. Moreover, it comes with various utilities, such
as flavours of ~isearch~ or ~grep~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package consult
    :defer t
    :bind
    ("C-S-s" . lps/consult-line-strict-match)
    ("C-c i" . lps/consult-imenu-or-org-heading)
    ("C-c r r" . consult-register-load)

    ([remap switch-to-buffer] . consult-buffer)

    ("M-g e" . consult-compile-error)
    ("M-g f" . consult-flymake)
    ("M-g o" . consult-outline)
    (:map isearch-mode-map
          ([remap isearch-edit-string] . consult-isearch-history))
    :custom
    (consult-narrow-key "<")
    (xref-show-definitions-function 'consult-xref)
    (xref-show-xrefs-function 'consult-xref)
    :config
    (defun lps/consult-imenu-or-org-heading ()
      (interactive)
      (if (equal major-mode 'org-mode)
          (consult-org-heading)
        (consult-imenu)))

    (defun lps/consult-line-strict-match (&optional initial start)
      (interactive (list nil (not (not current-prefix-arg))))
      (let ((orderless-matching-styles '(orderless-literal)))
        (consult-line initial start)))

    ;; Fix a bug in earlier version of Emacs
    (ensure-defun ensure-list "28.1" (x)
      (if (listp x) x (list x))))
#+end_src

Another package that tries to give contextual actions to act on "things" (files,
buffers ...) is ~embark~. It also integrates very well with the default API, and
is easily enhanced by packages such as ~marginalia~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package embark
    :defer t
    :bind
    ("C-," . embark-act)
    ([remap describe-bindings] . embark-bindings)
    (:map embark-file-map
          ("s" . lps/find-file-as-root))
    :custom
    (embark-action-indicator #'lps/embark-indicator-which-key)
    (embark-become-indicator embark-action-indicator)
    :config
    (defun lps/embark-indicator-which-key (map &rest _ignore)
      (which-key--show-keymap "Embark" map nil nil 'no-paging)
      #'which-key--hide-popup-ignore-command))

  (use-package embark-consult
    :after (consult embark))
#+end_src

** Some useful commands
*** Repeat commands
Some commands are usually invoked several times in succession. For example, if
you wish to resize a window, you might need to invoke =shrink-window= several
times. If we need to define repeat maps, we will do it in the corresponding
package rather than here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ensure-emacs-version 28.0
    (use-package repeat
      :only-built-in t
      :bind
      (:map lps/quick-edit-map
            ("z" . repeat))
      :init
      (repeat-mode 1)

      ;; Add visual indicator when repeat-mode is "activated"
      (defvar lps/default-cursor-background (face-background 'cursor))

      (defun lps/repeat-in-progress-change-cursor ()
        (set-cursor-color
         (if repeat-in-progress
             (face-foreground 'error)
           lps/default-cursor-background)))

      (add-hook 'post-command-hook
                'lps/repeat-in-progress-change-cursor
                90)))
#+end_src

*** Remapping and better defaults
Several commands are, surprinsingly, bound by default to some binding, while
there exists (arguably) simpler and more intuitive/DWIM-like versions of those
same commands. Most of the time, we really want to use those simpler commands,
and so we remap them to be invoked in place of their "strict" counterpart.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :bind
    ([remap upcase-word] . upcase-dwim)
    ([remap downcase-word] . downcase-dwim)
    ([remap capitalize-word] . capitalize-dwim)
    ([remap count-words-region] . count-words)
    ([remap count-words-region] . count-words))
#+end_src

* Editing

   Emacs is fundamentally a text editor. It provides a lot of functions to deal
   with text, and a way to create macros, to automate things, to repeat
   something multiple times ... easily. However, because there are /so many/
   available functions, we might need some help to navigate around and do fancy
   things.

** Special characters

Sometimes, we need to insert other characters than the ones available directly
"on the keyboard". In that case, Emacs provides several tools (input methods,
possibly transient, etc), or you can even pick characters by their Unicode names
or codepoints.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :custom
    (read-char-by-name-sort 'code))
#+end_src

** Multiple cursors

A first improvement is the addition of multiple cursors. The "rectangle region"
already gives a way to insert text simultaneously at several places, and to
perform some easy operations on a rectangular area, but the
[[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursor]] package
really increases the possibilities.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package multiple-cursors
    :defer t
    :init

#+end_src

The webpage specifies that the commands provided by this package are best
invoked when bound to key sequence rather than by =M-x <mc/command-name>=,
although some testing on my part seems to show that it still works relatively
well most of the time.

** Auto-completion

We fundamentally use Emacs to write text. What would writing be without some
kind of auto-completion ? Hence, we use a few tools to make the general
experience of /writing text/ better, whether it is source code, simple sentences
or even commands in the minibuffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
#+end_src

*** Completion styles

Emacs has a lot of built-in completions styles, telling it how to interpret the
input: as a regexp, as initials, as a substring ... We add some other ones, and
some possibilities to customize them or even change them on the fly. In order to
separate how those styles work for in-buffer completion compared to their
behaviour in minibuffer, we add hooks to the completion to change the completion
styles on the fly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Company backends

A first backend that we want to consider is the one using snippets provided by
~yasnippet~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-yasnippet
    :ensure nil
    :after company yasnippet
    :bind

    (defun lps/company-yasnippet-show-or-complete ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((company-backends '(company-yasnippet)))
        (call-interactively 'company-complete))))
#+end_src

Most of the time, when writing text, we are going to use words over and over
again in the same buffer. ~company-dabbrev~ will return completion candidates
based on this content.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-dabbrev
    :ensure nil

*** Corfu

[[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu]] is a frontend for ~completion-in-region~, which performs a role similar to
=autocomplete= or =company=: provide a "popup" when trying to complete in a buffer
(rather than in a minibuffer). It mostly relies on built-in Emacs functionality,
while =company= typically reimplements a lot of /ad-hoc/ functionality.

**** Cape

As for =company=, =corfu= can be improved using additional "backends", rather than
using only the built-in ~completion-at-point-functions~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package cape
    :defer t

    (dolist (cape-backend '(cape-dabbrev cape-file cape-elisp-block))

** Navigation
*** Structure based

We change a variable that makes sense for American writers, but not so much
according to French conventions. The Emacs Manual recommends against it, as we
are no longer able to distinguish a sentence ending from an abbreviation, but I
do not use this type of abbreviation very often anyway (notable counterexamples
nonetheless: /i.e./ and /e.g./).

We also add more convenient bindings to move paragraph by paragraph, and to deal
with long lines.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :bind
    ("M-n" . forward-paragraph)
    ("M-p" . backward-paragraph)
    (:map visual-line-mode-map
          ("C-S-a" . beginning-of-line)
          ("C-S-e" . end-of-line))
    :custom
    (sentence-end-double-space nil))
#+end_src

*** Text-search
Final touch: we often use the "search" functions to move the point around,
because it is often easier than mashing the ~C-f~ and ~C-n~ keys.

Hence, we add a few bindings to an already existing keymap, to make them easily
accessible again.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package isearch
    :ensure nil

          ("M-s" . isearch-forward) ;; avoids early/late release of Meta
          ("r" . isearch-backward)
          ("x" . isearch-forward-regexp))

    ;; Change this face to distinguish between current match and other ones
    (set-face-foreground 'isearch "yellow")
    (set-face-foreground 'lazy-highlight "yellow3"))

          ("C-%" . replace-regexp))
    :config
    (defun query-replace-number (num to-expr &optional delimited start end
                                     backward region-noncontiguous-p)
      "Similar to `query-replace', using Elisp capacities to handle numbers.
  More precisely, it will replace every number NUM of the region by the
  result of the (elisp) expression TO-EXPR.

  The function prompts for a *variable name* NUM, the value of which (when
  matched) is substituted in the occurrences of NUM within TO-EXPR. For
  example:

#+end_src

The previously defined commands are great to navigate in a buffer if you roughly
know where you want to end. However, we sometimes want to move the point to a
nearby, visible location, and instead of using and ~isearch~ and repeatedly use
the forward and backward bindings, we want to be able to quickly jump there
without thinking much, regardless of the current point position in the buffer.

    :defer t
    :bind
    ("M-é" . avy-goto-char-2)

** Rectangles

Manipulating rectangles is a cool Emacs feature. You can select a region with
the shape of a rectangle, copy and yank it, insert strings at the beginning of
each line of the selection, and several other features.

Because the functions operating on rectangles are not always the easier to
remember, we simply define a new Hydra referencing the most useful ones. We also
bind keys that were seemingly forgotten.

There is even a hidden gem in Emacs, which usually goes unknown for a (IMO)
stupid reason: it is ~cua-rectangle-mark-mode~, a (arguably better) different
way to manipulate rectangles and rectangular regions with Emacs. Being related
to CUA, with most people associate with "C-c/C-x/C-v bindings for
copy-cut-paste" and which is therefore almost non-existent in discussion between
"advanced" Emacs users, it is a feature that is generally absent from the list
'cool Emacs things that you can do, although the usual ~rectangle-mark-mode~
isn't. This is why we add a binding to ~rectangle-mark-mode~ to change the
current selection type to the more advanced ~CUA~ one.

** Selection

A useful tool to manipulate text and even source code is the
[[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] package, as it
allows us to increase the selected region to match larger and larger /semantic/
units. For example, by using it repeatedly, you could select in this order a
character, a word, a string containing this word, a sexp containing this string,
and the function in this sexp is used.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

We also define functions that Emacs is surprinsingly lacking.

The first one is used to copy without deleting the current line (internally, it
uses =kill-ring-save=, and so it can be used in a read-only context, unlike a
sequence like =C-a C-k C-y=). It is also much quicker than variations on the
sequence =C-e C-SPC C-a M-w=.

The next one is used to select the current line. Once a line is marked, we can
move it, delete it, copy it and so on easily. Having it on a single key binding
is quicker than having to do something like =C-a C-SPC C-e=

** Mark management

The mark is a key concept of Emacs. It is used to navigate, make selections,
cycle through the jump history ... Because we use ~transient-mark-mode~ (the

command in particular needs to be improved

      "Exchange point and mark, but reactivate mark a bit less often.

    Specifically, invert the meaning of ARG in the case where
    Transient Mark mode is on but the region is inactive."

#+end_src

As several commands can act on the mark without it being visible, it might be
nice to be able to /see/ the mark position at all time -- in particular,
~exchange-point-and-mark~ would benefit from this, as we could immediately see
where the point would end up.

** Moving stuff around

A big part of editing text consists in moving already written lines, words or
paragraphs around. Emacs provides a set of basic functions to do, with
~transpose-<chars/lines/sexps>~ and so on, but they are not very intuitive and a
bit clumsy to use. This is why we use another package, which will allow us to
move entire blocks of text much more naturally

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package drag-stuff
    :config
    (setq drag-stuff-except-modes '(org-mode
                                    tabulated-list-mode))
    (drag-stuff-global-mode 1)
    (drag-stuff-define-keys))
#+end_src

Because we added other, more "Emacs-y" bindings to move by paragraphs, we are
free to use the original bindings to do more useful stuff. Instead of simply
/moving/ things here, we are duplicating them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :bind
    ("<C-down>" . lps/duplicate-line-or-region-down)
    ("<C-up>" . lps/collapse-line-up)
    :config
    (defun lps/duplicate-line-or-region-down (arg)
      "Duplicate current line or region if active.
  Move point in the last duplicated string (line or region)."
      (interactive "*p")
      (if (region-active-p)
          (progn
            (save-excursion
              (let* ((bor (region-beginning))
                     (eor (region-end))
                     (content (buffer-substring bor eor)))
                (goto-char eor)
                (end-of-line) ; necessary if region is inside longer line
                (dotimes (i arg)
                  (newline)
                  (insert content))))
            (next-line (* arg (count-lines (region-beginning) (region-end)))))

        (save-excursion
          ;; local variables for start and end of line
          (let* ((bol (progn (beginning-of-line) (point)))
                 (eol (progn (end-of-line) (point)))
                 (line (buffer-substring bol eol)))
            (dotimes (i arg)
              (newline)
              (insert line))))
        (next-logical-line arg)))

    (defun lps/collapse-line-up (arg)
      "Delete the current line and move point on the previous line"
      (interactive "*p")

          (previous-logical-line arg)
          (setq final (point)))

        (goto-char final))))
#+end_src

** Undo

Another light-weight option to improve on the built-in ~undo~, which tends to
work better than some others choices (notably, =undo-tree=) with some built-in
Emacs features such as as "undo-in-region", is =vundo=. It has become much more
usable in newer versions of Emacs, where the undo systems has gained some new
commands, making it behave more like in most other tools.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package vundo
    :defer t
    :hook (vundo-mode . lps/enable-auto-hscroll-scroll)
    :bind
    ("C-_" . undo)
    ("M-_" . undo-redo)
    ("C-x u" . vundo)
    :custom
    (vundo-glyph-alist vundo-unicode-symbols)
    (vundo-compact-display nil)
    (vundo-window-max-height 5))
#+end_src

** Regexp

We add a few functions that are used later in the config. Their purpose is more
or less to "prevent" some commands from acting on some regions of the buffer, by
deleting them, then processing the file, and inserting them somewhere else
afterwards.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun lps/find-delete-forward-all-regexp (re &optional beg)
    "Searches for all the matches of the regexp RE after the point, or after the optional position BEG.
    Returns a list of strings containing the matches in order, or nil if none was found.
    Deletes (rather than kill) those matches from the buffer"
    (save-excursion
      (let (matches)
        (goto-char (or beg (point)))
        (while (re-search-forward re nil t)
          (push (match-string 0) matches)
          (delete-region (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
        matches)))

  (defun lps/move-all-regexp-pos-buffer (re &optional beg move split)
    "Moves all the string matching the regexp RE after the point (or after BEG) to the end of the buffer
  (or to the position MOVE if provided)
    If SPLIT is provided, it will be inserted before each match, including the first one.
    The initial strings are destroyed, and the kill-ring is not modified"
    (save-excursion
      (let ((matches (nreverse (lps/find-delete-forward-all-regexp re beg))))
        (goto-char (or move (point-max)))
        (while matches
          (insert (or split ""))
          (insert (pop matches))))))
#+end_src

There are also various packages implementing ~grep~, ~ripgrep~ and so on. One of
them is especially nice, and is called ~wgrep~. It does the same thing to ~grep~
buffer than ~wdired~ does to Dired ones: make them editable as plain text, and
commit the changes to the files (or the filesystem, for Dired) !

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package wgrep
    :bind
    (:map grep-mode-map
          ("C-x C-q" . wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode)))
#+end_src

** Align
A very useful and yet relatively unknown Emacs built-in package is ~align~,
which provides a few functions to align things according to several criteria,
and acting on various parts of the buffer (region, section ...)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package align
    :ensure nil
    :bind
    (:map lps/quick-edit-map
          ("C-a a" . align)
          ("C-a e" . align-entire)
          ("C-a x" . align-regexp)
          ("C-a c" . align-current)))
#+end_src

** Blank lines and lines manipulation
We often want to insert, delete, in a word, /manipulate/ blank lines. Hence, we
will define and rebind a few commands for that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :bind
    (:map lps/manipulate-lines-map
          ("p" . lps/insert-line-above)
          ("n" . lps/insert-line-below)
          ("l" . list-matching-lines)
          ("s" . sort-lines)
          ("b" . delete-blank-lines)
          ("d" . delete-matching-lines)
          ("k" . keep-lines))
    :custom
    (list-matching-lines-default-context-lines 1)
    (list-matching-lines-jump-to-current-line t)
    :config
    (defun lps/insert-line-above (N)
      (interactive "P")
      (save-excursion
        (beginning-of-line)
        (newline-and-indent N)))

    (defun lps/insert-line-below (N)
      (interactive "P")
      (save-excursion
        (end-of-line)
        (newline-and-indent N))))
#+end_src

** Personal commands

We also define a bunch of functions and commands related to editing text that
are not provided in Emacs by default, and would be too specific to find in a
package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    :ensure nil

    (:map lps/quick-edit-map
          ("C-u" . lps/underline-or-frame-dwim)

          ("i" . lps/insert-file-name))
    (:map lisp-data-mode-map
          ("M-*" . lps/earmuffify))
    :config
    (defun lps/fill-width-repeat-string (width str)
      "Insert STR as many times as necessary to fill WIDTH,

      (let* ((len (length str))
             (k (/ width len))
             (rem (% width len)))

          (insert str))
        (insert (substring str 0 rem))))

    (defun lps/underline-or-frame-dwim (str &optional arg)
      "Underlines the current line with the string STR or with `comment-start'

* Programming
** Project management

There used to be a fancy and recommended package named
[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]]. However, Emacs evolved
and some code to work with "projects" has been added and is now built-in. As
such, I rely on this basic core of functionalities, upgraded (or not) with
various packages that try to build on top of it, rather than reimplementing
everything as Projectile did.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package project
    :defer t

    ;; Difficulties with symlinks, which I use a lot
    (project-vc-merge-submodules nil))
#+end_src

One package that extends the functionalities provided by the builtin
~project.el~ is [[https://github.com/mohkale/projection][Projection]]. In
particular, it provides ways to compile, run, package, test the current project
using some handcrafted rules to detect the "build manager" (.NET, CMake, meson
and so on).

Being one of the most popular Emacs packages, there are various other packages
that try to further improve it to integrate it with other Emacs tools.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit-todos
    :after magit
    :custom
    (magit-todos-rg-extra-args '("--follow"))
    :config
    (magit-todos-mode 1))
#+end_src

**** Transient
In fact, the UI used by Magit can be used in several other applications, and is
not specific to Magit itself. Nonetheless, Magit being the most prominent
package using this library, we configure it here. In particular, we don't want
to hide anything, although we keep some visual information to show commands that
are "intended for experts".

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package transient
    :defer t
    :custom
    (transient-highlight-higher-levels t)
    (transient-default-level 7)
    :config
    ;; Replace the underline with a slanted text, less disturbing
    (set-face-attribute 'transient-higher-level nil
                        :underline nil
                        :italic t))
#+end_src

*** Git-timemachine

Another useful package is
[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/git-timemachine][git-timemachine]], which
allows to easily navigate the history of a git-controlled file with a few key
presses.

Although Magit is more or less able to do the same thing, the interface there is
cleaner and you are less likely to get lost than in the fully-featured
super-package that Magit is.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package git-timemachine
    :defer t)
#+end_src

*** Forge
We will probably want to work with distant repositories, /e.g./ stored on a
distant GitHub or GitLab host.

In order to integrate more tightly with those tools, and have access to more
complex features than the basic ones provided by Git itself, we use a package
called [[https://magit.vc/manual/forge/][Forge]]. For example, it will allow us
to do pull-requests, or edit issues, directly from Emacs, rather than having to
connect to the online GitHub website or to use another API provided by some
other software.

*MANUAL* In order to use this package, you need to have a personal "token", so
that the server knows who you are ! To setup everything, follow the instructions
in the Forge manual.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package forge
    :after magit
    :custom
    (forge-bug-reference-hooks nil))
#+end_src

*** Diff and merge conflicts
Whenever we use version control, merge conflicts will unavoidably arise. Hence,
we need to be able to solve them as efficiently and clearly as possible, and
Emacs provides a few tools for this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package smerge-mode
    :defer t
    :hook
    (find-file . lps/smerge-maybe-start)
    :bind-keymap
    ("C-c m" . smerge-basic-map)
    :init
    (defvar smerge-repeat-map
      (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
        (dolist (key-cmd '(("n" smerge-next)
                           ("p" smerge-prev)
                           ("a" smerge-keep-all)
                           ("l" smerge-keep-lower)
                           ("u" smerge-keep-upper)
                           ("b" smerge-keep-base)
                           ("r" smerge-resolve)))
          (let ((key (car key-cmd))
                (cmd (cadr key-cmd)))
            (define-key map (kbd key) cmd)
            (put cmd 'repeat-map 'smerge-repeat-map)))
        map))
    :config
    (defun lps/smerge-maybe-start ()
      (when (and buffer-file-name (vc-backend buffer-file-name))
        (save-excursion
          (goto-char (point-min))
          (when (re-search-forward smerge-begin-re nil t)
            (message "Smerge-mode automatically enabled: there seem to be conflicts !")
            (smerge-mode 1))))))
#+end_src

Although looking at, merging, and dealing with diffs in not strictly related to
version control, I believe it is the appropriate time to talk about Ediff. Ediff
is (one of the) the built-in modes to visualize side-by-side diffs of different
files, and possibly edit and merge them. The defaults are a bit lacking, in
particular when it comes to layout/UI, so this is one of the main changes we do.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ediff
    :defer t
    :hook
    (ediff-before-setup . lps/ediff-save-window-configuration)
    :custom
    (ediff-split-window-function 'split-window-horizontally)
    (ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain)
    :config
    (defvar lps/ediff-saved-window-configuration nil)

    (defun lps/ediff-save-window-configuration ()
      (setq lps/ediff-saved-window-configuration (current-window-configuration)))

    (defun lps/ediff-restore-window-configuration ()
      (set-window-configuration lps/ediff-saved-window-configuration))

    ;; Weird name for the following hook: may be not supposed to use it ?
    (add-hook 'ediff-after-quit-hook-internal 'lps/ediff-restore-window-configuration))
#+end_src

** Parenthesis

First of all, we want to easily be able to tell with a quick glance which
parenthesis are matching

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Always highlight matching parenthesis
  (use-package paren
    :ensure nil
    :only-built-in t
    :init
    (show-paren-mode t)
    :custom
    ;; (show-paren-style 'mixed) ; Too invasive
    (show-paren-when-point-inside-paren t)
    (show-paren-when-point-in-periphery t)
    (show-paren-context-when-offscreen t))

  ;; rainbow-delimiters. Hightlights with the same colour matching parenthesis
  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :hook ((prog-mode comint-mode LaTeX-mode) . rainbow-delimiters-mode))
#+end_src

Now, in order to work with structured text, such as source code, we want to be
able to directly manipulate "expressions" rather than lines or words. This is
why we use the following packages, as they provide a lot of functionalities to
navigate and edit those expressions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package paredit
    :init
    (defun lps/paredit-enable-electric-pair-disable ()
      (paredit-mode 1)
      (electric-pair-local-mode -1))

    :hook ((sly-mrepl-mode
            eshell-mode
            ielm-mode
            eval-expression-minibuffer-setup
            lisp-data-mode
            cider-mode
            cider-repl-mode)
           . lps/paredit-enable-electric-pair-disable)

    :bind
     ;; Not restricted to paredit but useful sexp manipulation
    ("C-M-<backspace>" . backward-kill-sexp) ; why is NOT already there ?!
    ("C-S-t" . transpose-sexps)
    (:map paredit-mode-map
          ("M-?" . nil)
          ("C-S-w" . paredit-copy-as-kill)
          ("M-s" . nil) ;; To get isearch-mode-map
          ("M-s M-s" . paredit-splice-sexp)
          ("C-M-;" . paredit-convolute-sexp)
          ([remap newline] . paredit-newline)
          ("C-j" . nil)
          ("<C-backspace>" . paredit-delete-region))
    :config
    ;; Version 29 or 30 broke something ?!
    ;; Remove paredit broken RET key
    (define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd "RET") nil t)

    (defun lps/paredit-no-space-insert-after-sharp-dispatch (endp delimiter)
      "Always return T, unless we are right after a #<form> where form is only made of
  characters of WORD syntax
  This ensures that no space is inserted after e.g. #2A or #C"
      (not (and (/= (point) (line-beginning-position))
                (= delimiter ?\()
                (not endp)
                (or (looking-back "#\\w+")
                    (looking-back ",@")))))

    (add-to-list 'paredit-space-for-delimiter-predicates
    'lps/paredit-no-space-insert-after-sharp-dispatch))

  (use-package elec-pair
    :only-built-in t
    :hook ((prog-mode
            org-mode
            inferior-python-mode)
           . electric-pair-local-mode)) ;; needed for org-babel

  (use-package adjust-parens
    :after paredit
    :hook (paredit-mode . adjust-parens-mode)
    :bind
    (:map adjust-parens-mode-map
          ("TAB" . nil)
          ("<backtab>" . nil)
          ("M-<left>" . lps/lisp-dedent-adjust-parens)
          ("M-<right>" . lps/lisp-indent-adjust-parens))
    :config
    (defun lps/lisp-dedent-adjust-parens ()
      (interactive)
      (save-excursion
        (back-to-indentation)
        (call-interactively 'lisp-dedent-adjust-parens)))

    (defun lps/lisp-indent-adjust-parens ()
      (interactive)
      (save-excursion
        (back-to-indentation)
        (call-interactively 'lisp-indent-adjust-parens))))
#+end_src

Finally, we also remap one built-in command to a (usually) more useful variant,
which has the same behaviour as the paredit one. We bind a customize a few
built-in commands related to parenthesis.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :init
    (defun lps/insert-parentheses (&optional arg)
      "Same as `insert-parentheses' but if no ARG is provided, it wraps
  the next s-expression in parentheses rather than inserting () at point
  Does not insert a space before the inserted opening parenthesis"
      (interactive "P")
      (let ((parens-require-spaces nil))
        (if arg
            (insert-parentheses arg)
          (insert-parentheses 1))))

    (defun lps/insert-quotes (&optional arg)
      "Same as `lps/insert-parentheses' with quotes \" characters "
      (interactive "P")
      (let ((parens-require-spaces nil))
        (if arg
            (insert-pair arg ?\" ?\")
          (insert-pair 1 ?\" ?\"))))

    (defun lps/transpose-sexp-backward ()
      (interactive)
      (transpose-sexps 1)
      (backward-sexp 2))

    (defun lps/transpose-sexp-forward ()
      (interactive)
      (forward-sexp 1)
      (transpose-sexps 1)
      (backward-sexp 1))

    :bind
    ([remap insert-parentheses] . lps/insert-parentheses)
    ("M-\"" . lps/insert-quotes)
    ("C-M-z" . delete-pair)
    (:map prog-mode-map
          ("M-S-<left>" . lps/transpose-sexp-backward)
          ("M-S-<right>" . lps/transpose-sexp-forward))
    :custom
    (delete-pair-blink-delay 0.2))
#+end_src

** Better auto-completion

The previous Auto-completion section was about the general editing experience.
Here, we add extra tools that will be particularly interesting when editing some
kind of source code, which is by nature much more repetitive and rigid.

*** Dynamic Abbreviations
One of the default facilities provided by Emacs for auto-completion is
~dabbrev~. In short, it is a way to complete what you are currently typing using
"stuff" with the same prefix, in some open buffer of your emacs session. You can
restrict the source buffers in various ways, but this is the basic idea. It can
be (conceptually) further improved by taking possible completions from other
sources (such as filenames); the result is the built-in function
~hippie-expand~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package hippie-exp
    :bind ([remap dabbrev-expand] . hippie-expand))
#+end_src

*** YASnippet

A first useful package is YASnippet, which makes it easy to define and
automatically insert snippets of code in various languages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;;YASnippet
  (use-package yasnippet
    :init
    (defvar lps/snippets-dir-root
      (expand-file-name "snippets" user-emacs-directory))
    :custom
    (yas-verbosity 1)
    :hook (prog-mode . yas-minor-mode)
    :bind (:map yas-minor-mode-map
                ("TAB" . nil)
                ("<tab>" . nil))
    :config
    (defun lps/snippets-initialize ()
      "Initialize personnal snippets, so Yasnippet can see them."
      (when (boundp 'yas-snippet-dirs)
        (add-to-list 'yas-snippet-dirs lps/snippets-dir-root t))
      (yas-load-directory lps/snippets-dir-root))

    (lps/snippets-initialize))
#+end_src

It is even possible to define your own snippets. The following package contains
a lot of useful snippets for various programming languages or tools, such a C++,
Clojure, various Makefiles, Emacs' Org-Mode ...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet-snippets
    :after yasnippet)
#+end_src

** Language Server Protocol
*** Protocol

    The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol][Language Server Protocol]] is a protocol which facilitates the use of
    several languages with various IDE. Instead of specifying a syntax, ..., for
    each pair "IDE/Language", it aims at abstracting the specifities of each
    language, so that each IDE will need to communicate with a server that will
    give back the information needed to do IDE-y things such as highlighting or
    auto-completion in an unified manner.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :only-built-in nil
    :hook ((python-mode
            c-mode
            c++-mode
            haskell-mode)
           . lps/lsp-by-default-in-session)
    :init
    ;; Abstract away the client used: lsp-mode or eglot
    (defvar lps/language-server-client 'eglot)

    (defun lps/start-language-server ()
      (interactive)
      (call-interactively lps/language-server-client))

    ;; Sometimes, we don't want to start a full server just to check a
    ;; file or make a few edits to it. In my use, this mostly depends
    ;; on the session: In a quick session, I might not want to start a
    ;; server for one or two files, however, once I start using LSP,
    ;; there is no reason not to assume that I also want to use it by
    ;; default for other files in the same session
    (defvar lps/default-lsp-mode -1) ; change to ask for LSP on startup

    (defun lps/lsp-by-default-in-session ()
      (if (> lps/default-lsp-mode 0)
          (lps/start-language-server)
        (if (and (= lps/default-lsp-mode 0)
                 (y-or-n-p "Automatically use lsp-mode in the current session ?"))
            (progn
              (setq lps/default-lsp-mode 1)
              (lps/start-language-server)))
        (setq lps/default-lsp-mode -1)))

    (defun lps/toggle-lsp-by-default-in-session ()
      (interactive)
      (setq lps/default-lsp-mode (not lps/default-lsp-mode)))

    ;; Fix documentation: don't want to start a server to view some
    ;; C code in helpful buffers !
    (advice-ensure-bindings helpful-update ((lps/default-lsp-mode -1))))
#+end_src

*** LSP-mode

LSP-mode is the most featureful client for Emacs. It provides a lot of fancy
stuff, especially in terms of UI: popups, graphical widgets ...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; LSP mode. Useful IDE-like features
  (use-package lsp-mode
    :disabled t
    :commands (lsp lsp-deferred)
    :custom
    (lsp-diagnostics-provider :flymake)  ; :none if none wanted
    :config
    (define-key lsp-mode-map (kbd "C-c l") lsp-command-map)
    (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)
    (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil)
    (setq lsp-enable-on-type-formatting nil))

  (use-package lsp-ui
    :after lsp-mode
    :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode)
    :custom
    (lsp-ui-doc-enable nil)
    (lsp-ui-doc-position 'bottom)
    (lsp-ui-doc-delay 1)
    (lsp-ui-sideline-show-code-actions nil))
#+end_src

*** Eglot

There exists another implementation of the Language Server Protocol in Emacs,
called [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]]. It is much more integrated within "core" Emacs, as it only uses
built-in packages, such as =project.el= instead of ~projectile~, or ~flymake~ rather
than ~flycheck~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Might not work, recommended to use package-install instead
  ;; Dependencies might not be the correct ones

  (use-package eglot
    ;;:hook ((python-mode c-mode c++-mode) . eglot-ensure)
    :hook (eglot-managed-mode . lps/eldoc-set-documentation-strategy)
    :ensure nil
    :only-built-in t
    :init

** Errors and syntax checking

Although there exists [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][Flycheck]], a
modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension to Emacs, the built-in Flymake is
sufficient for my purposes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Flycheck
  (use-package flymake
    :only-built-in t
    ;; :bind-keymap
    ;; ("C-c !" . flymake-mode-map)
    :bind
    (:map flymake-mode-map
          ("C-c ! c" . flymake-start)
          ("C-c ! l" . flymake-show-buffer-diagnostics)
          ("C-c ! L" . flymake-show-project-diagnostics)
          ("C-c ! n" . flymake-goto-next-error)
          ("C-c ! p" . flymake-goto-prev-error))
    :config
    (defvar flymake-repeat-map
      (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
        (define-key map (kbd "n") #'flymake-goto-next-error)
        (define-key map (kbd "p") #'flymake-goto-prev-error)
        (define-key map (kbd "l") #'flymake-show-buffer-diagnostics)
        map))
    (dolist (cmd '(flymake-goto-next-error
                   flymake-goto-prev-error
                   flymake-show-buffer-diagnostics))
      (put cmd 'repeat-map 'flymake-repeat-map)))
#+end_src

** Compilation
In several programming languages, it is useful to have a way to compile the
current program easily. We will use the built-in ~compile~ command for this, and
tune it as we need.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package compile
    :ensure nil
    :only-built-in t
    :bind
    (:map prog-mode-map
          ("<f5>" . lps/auto-compile))
    :custom
    (compilation-message-face nil)
    :bind
    (:map compilation-button-map
          ("C-<return>" . compile-goto-error)
          ("C-RET" . compile-goto-error))
    :init
    (defvar lps/auto-compile-command-alist nil
      "Alist containing commands to run to automatically compile the
  current file.

   Elements are of the form (MODE . COMMAND) where COMMAND is a
  function or a symbol. COMMAND can also be a string, in which case
  it is passed as-is to the `compile' function.")

    (defun lps/auto-compile ()
      "If the current major mode is in `lps/auto-compile-command-alist',
  call the associated function interactively. Otherwise, call the
  `compile' command"
      (interactive)
      (let ((command (or (alist-get major-mode lps/auto-compile-command-alist)
                         (alist-get (alist-get major-mode major-mode-remap-alist)
                                    lps/auto-compile-command-alist))))
        (cond
         ((commandp command)
          (call-interactively command))
         ((stringp command)
          (call-interactively 'compile command))
         ((null command)
          (error "No auto-compile command specified in %s" major-mode))
         (t
          (call-interactively 'compile)))))

    (defun lps/add-auto-compile-mode (mode command)
      (add-to-list 'lps/auto-compile-command-alist (cons mode command))))
#+end_src

** Documentation

Emacs has a built-in way to find, show, compose ... documentation: the package
responsible for all of that is called ~eldoc~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package eldoc
    :custom
    (eldoc-documentation-strategy 'eldoc-documentation-compose-eagerly)
    :config
    (with-eval-after-load 'paredit
      (eldoc-add-command-completions "paredit-"))
    ;; Put that in a function: needed for Eglot ...
    (defun lps/eldoc-set-documentation-strategy ()
      (setq eldoc-documentation-strategy 'eldoc-documentation-compose-eagerly)))
#+end_src

** REPL and CLI

Many programming languages have, in one way or another, a REPL or a command-line
interface. Although some modes will be configured independently, there are some
tweaks that we want everywhere, regardless of the mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :custom
    (comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input t)
    (comint-prompt-read-only t)
    (comint-completion-addsuffix nil))
#+end_src

** Programming languages

In this section, we fine-tune our editing tools for various programming
languages.
*** Python

We need to specify which server LSP will use. Several packages are available.

*MANUAL* Before using LSP, use the following command to install a server:

=pip install --user python-language-server[all]=

The command ~pyls~ needs to be available on the ~PATH~ environment variable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package python
    :defer t
    ;;    :hook (python-mode . lps/run-python)
    :custom
    (python-shell-interpreter "python3")
    :config
    (defun lps/run-python ()
      (save-excursion
        (call-interactively 'run-python)))

    (lps/add-auto-compile-mode 'python-mode 'python-shell-send-buffer)

    (push 'company-indent-or-complete-common python-indent-trigger-commands))
#+end_src

Finally, we can improve the interpreter by allowing it to handle multi-line
statements better. Terminal emulators are lame and have trouble doing it without
massive changes (hello, IPython !), but this is Emacs, we can do whatever we
want.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package python-mls
    :after python
    :hook (inferior-python-mode . python-mls-mode))
#+end_src

*** OCaml

For OCaml, we do not use LSP mode, and we instead choose to work with a specific
minor mode called [[https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg][Tuareg]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Tuareg (for OCaml and ML like languages)
  (use-package tuareg
    :defer t
    :config
    (setq tuareg-indent-align-with-first-arg t)
    (setq tuareg-match-patterns-aligned t))
#+end_src

*** C/C++

We first configure a few default parameters, some of which are overriden by
Emacs' standard ~cc-mode~ and the like, in order to have a consistent experience
with other programming languages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package cc-mode
    :custom
    (c-tab-always-indent tab-always-indent)
    ;; :bind
    ;; (:map c-mode-base-map
    ;;       ("TAB" . indent-for-tab-command)
    ;;       ("<tab>" . indent-for-tab-command))
    )
#+end_src

We also use custom compilation commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :config
    (defun lps/c-c++-mode-basic-compile-command ()
      (interactive)
      (let* ((buf (file-name-nondirectory (or (buffer-file-name) (buffer-name))))
             (buf-no-ext (file-name-sans-extension buf))
             (c-mode-p (eq major-mode 'c-mode))
             (compiler (if c-mode-p "cc " "c++ ")))
        (compile (concat compiler buf " -o " buf-no-ext))))

    (lps/add-auto-compile-mode 'c-mode 'lps/c-c++-mode-basic-compile-command))
#+end_src

As C and C++ are also quite "close to the metal", it is often useful (for
optimization or learning purposes) to view what the compiled code looks like. Of
course, Emacs has ways to work with assembly (/e.g.,/ [[help:asm-mode][asm-mode]]), but we can even
see the assembly code /while still editing the source/ !

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package disaster
    :after cc-mode
    :bind
    (:map c-mode-base-map
          ("C-c C-d" . disaster)))
#+end_src

*** Rust

Orange Crab Language.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package rust-mode
    :defer t
    :custom
    (rust-mode-treesitter-derive t))

  (use-package rustic
    :ensure nil
    :after rust-mode
    :custom
    (rustic-lsp-setup-p nil)
    (rustic-popup-commands
     '((?b "build"      build)
       (?f "fmt"        fmt)
       (?r "run"        run)
       (?i "comint-run" comint-run)
       (?c "clippy"     clippy)
       (?o "outdated"   outdated)
       (?e "clean"      clean)
       (?k "check"      check)
       (?t "test"       test)
       (?d "doc"        doc)))

    (rustic-lsp-client 'eglot))
#+end_src

*** Assembly
As mentioned in the previous sections, there are already a few tools to work
with assembly code within Emacs. We add a few functions wrapping some
command-line utilities from the GNU binutils package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :after hexl
    :bind
    (:map hexl-mode-map
          ("C-c C-r" . lps/readelf))
    :config
    ;; Heavily inspired by https://github.com/abo-abo/elf-mode/blob/master/elf-mode.el
    ;; Same thing, I simply do not want to add extra packages for no reason
    (defvar lps/readelf-command "readelf -a -W %s")
    (defun lps/readelf ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((cur-file (buffer-file-name))
            (elf-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Elf*")))
        (with-current-buffer elf-buffer
          (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
            (insert (shell-command-to-string
                     (format lps/readelf-command cur-file)))
            (set-buffer-modified-p nil)
            (special-mode)))
        (pop-to-buffer elf-buffer))))
#+end_src

*** Lisp
**** Generic
As Lisp dialects are often similar, at least syntactically, there are some
packages who are interesting regardless of the exact language being used.

The first one is adapted to Common Lisp via a SLY extension, but was already
implemented for Emacs Lisp before that. It - arguably - improves the
macroexansion process, and allows one to quickly view what a macroexpansion is,
/without/ actually modifying the source code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package macrostep
    :bind
    (:map lps/quick-edit-map
          ("e" . macrostep-expand)))
#+end_src

We also define a basic, personal file extension that we use to store lisp data
in several projects (where "lisp data" really mean "basic s-expressions"):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :mode ("\\.lispdata\\'" . lisp-data-mode))
#+end_src

**** Emacs Lisp

Although Emacs comes with pretty good built-in functionalities, there is still
room for improvement.

[[https://github.com/Fanael/highlight-defined][highlight defined]] highlights defined Emacs Lisp symbols (functions, variable
names, macros ...) in source code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package highlight-defined
    :hook (emacs-lisp-mode . highlight-defined-mode))

#+end_src

[[https://github.com/Silex/elmacro][elmacro]] shows keyboard macros and interactive commands as Emacs Lisp, meaning
that if you know /how/ to do something using advanced keyboard shortcuts or
interactive commands, you can get for free an elisp code snippet that does
exactly the same thing that you can reuse /e.g./ in a configuration file or in
another function.

Because it might be useful everywhere, we do not use it simply in
=emacs-lisp-mode= and we activate it everywhere.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package elmacro
    :defer t)
#+end_src

We define a useful function to evaluate an expression, and replace it with the
result. This, in conjunction with macros and multiple cursors, is a great tool
to automate otherwise boring tasks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :bind
    ("C-c C-e" . lps/eval-and-replace-last-sexp)
    (:map lps/quick-edit-map
          ("x" . emacs-lisp-macroexpand)
          ("C-r" . lps/print-eval-region)
          ("C-e" . lps/eval-and-replace-last-sexp))

    :config
    (defun lps/eval-and-replace-last-sexp ()
      "Evaluate the last s-expression, and replace it with the result"
      (interactive)
      (pp-eval-last-sexp 1)
      (save-excursion
        (backward-sexp 2)
        (kill-sexp 1)))

    (defun lps/print-eval-region (start end)
      (interactive "r")
      (eval-region start end t)))
#+end_src

**** Common Lisp

We could, of course, use LSP to write Common Lisp code. However, Emacs already
provides nice editing functionalities for programming in Lisp-like languages,
and CL is no exception. On top of the built-in Emacs functions, we use another
minor mode, specifically designed to write Common Lisp: [[https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][SLIME]]. More precisely,
we use a /fork/ of SLIME, known as [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly][SLY]].

*MANUAL* It is likely that ~sbcl~ is not already installed. Hence, in order to run
the following code, you will need to install it. If you install it manuallyby
compiling the source code, make sure that the ~sbcl~ command is available on the
PATH, or modify =:custom (inferior-lisp-program "<path/to/sbcl>")= accordingly in
the following block. Moreover, if you want to access the CL HyperSpec offline,
you need to download it, and have ~common-lisp-hyperspec-root~ point towards it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
  ;; Make sure that sbcl is available on PATH
  (use-package sly
    :hook
    (lisp-mode . sly-editing-mode)

On top of this environment and compiler, we also need an access to external

a SLY integration.

We also add extra-packages to facilitate some usual operations.

Finally, we add some snippets for an even faster programming experience:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package common-lisp-snippets
    :after yasnippet sly
    :config
    (let ((modifier "M-"))
      (dolist (bind '(("L" . "lambda")))
        (define-key sly-editing-mode-map (kbd (concat modifier (car bind)))
          (lambda ()
            (interactive)
            (yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet (cdr bind))))))))
#+end_src

**** Clojure
Finally, another recent and promising Lisp, which is much more opinionated than
Common Lisp and runs on the JVM. It is a functional language, with a strong
emphasis on immutable data structure, and has various tools that make concurrent
programming easy.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package cider
    :defer t)
#+end_src

*** Haskell

Haskell is a functional, strongly typed programming language. A variety of modes
have been written for it, and are pretty much necessary, as Haskell's syntax and
source files look nothing like "basic C/Java" at all and so we cannot simply use
variants of ~c-mode~ to program in Haskell.

*MANUAL* [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/][Cabal]] and [[https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle][Hoogle]] need to be installed separately. Once ~cabal~ is
installed, you can just call =cabal update && cabal install hoogle= to install
~Hoogle~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package haskell-mode
    :defer t
    :mode
    ("\\.hs\\'" . haskell-mode)
    ("\\.lhs\\'" . haskell-mode)
    :hook
    (haskell-mode . haskell-collapse-mode)
    (haskell-mode . interactive-haskell-mode)
    (haskell-mode . hindent-mode)
    (haskell-mode . haskell-indentation-mode)
    :custom
    (haskell-process-suggest-remove-import-lines t)  ; warnings for redundant imports etc
    (haskell-process-auto-import-loaded-modules t)
    (haskell-process-show-overlays nil)) ; redundant with flycheck

  (use-package haskell-snippets
    :after yasnippet haskell-mode)
#+end_src

For all the intelligent stuff (completion, refactoring ...), we will not bother
setting up numerous fancy modes but we rely instead on LSP. Although it is not
my preferred way of doing things, I am not a Haskell guru at all, and don't use
it that much, so a simple "Out of the box" experience will be fine, even if it
is a bit bloated and offers less customization facilities.

*MANUAL* The language server needs to be installed manually. I use
[[https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server][haskell-language-server]] in this config. Be careful when installing ~ghcup~ and the
likes. In some cases, only your ~.bashrc~ will be modified to add ~~/.ghcup/...~ to
your PATH environment variable. This makes Emacs unable to locate the correct
binaries for the language server, even if you specify the full path to the
wrapper (Emacs will then be able to correctly start the wrapper, but the wrapper
itself won't be able to locate the correct binaries). In this case, simply move
the corresponding line from your ~.bashrc~ (probably the last one, or towards the
end of the file), to ~~/.profile~ or ~~/.bash_profile~, so the PATH is correctly
setup even outside of interactive bash terminals and Emacs will always inherit
it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-haskell
    :defer t
    :custom
    (lsp-haskell-server-path "~/.ghcup/bin/haskell-language-server-wrapper"))
#+end_src

*** Web development
**** Javascript
The built-in ~js-mode~ is good, but as it is often the case with Emacs and popular
languages, it has been improved in community packages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package js2-mode
    :defer t
    :mode
    (("\\.js\\'" . js2-mode))
    :custom
    (js2-include-node-externs t))
#+end_src

We also a language server to help us with refactoring, completion and other
fancy IDE-like features.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tide
    :hook
    (js2-mode . lps/setup-tide-mode)
    (tide . lps/add-tide-hooks)
    :config
    (defun lps/setup-tide-mode ()
      "Set up Tide mode."
      (interactive)
      (tide-setup)
      (flymake-mode 1)
      (tide-hl-identifier-mode 1)
      (if (and tide-completion-setup-company-backend
               (not (or (eq 'company-tide (car company-backends))
                        (member 'company-tide (car company-backends)))))
          (setq-local company-backends (list (cons 'company-tide
                                                   (car company-backends))))))

    (defun lps/add-tide-hooks ()
      (add-hook 'before-save-hook #'tide-format-before-save nil t)))
#+end_src

**** HTML/CSS
For HTML/CSS, we use another featureful package called =web-mode=. It can also be
used to deal with Javascript or PHP code, but in my opinion, there are better
alternatives for those specifically, so I only use =web-mode= for HTML/CSS (and
their numerous variants ...).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package web-mode
    :defer t
    :mode
    (("\\.html?" . web-mode))
    :hook
    (web-mode . rainbow-mode))
#+end_src

Because HTML tends to be very verbose, we also want to be able to quickly type
the usual boilerplate. We use =emmet-mode=, which implement a way to quickly
expand (many) abbreviations into templates. It is somewhat similar to =Yasnippet=,
with some differences nonetheless, and the two can be used at the same time so
why would we have to choose ?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emmmet-mode
    :defer t
    :disabled t
    :hook
    ((sgml-mode css-mode web-mode) . emmet-mode)
    :custom
    (emmet-move-cursor-between-quotes t))
#+end_src

*** Java
Despite not being the best editor to program in Java, Emacs is still quite
capable, in particular when using LSP.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package eglot-java
    :after eglot
    :hook (java-mode . eglot-java-mode))
#+end_src

*** C#

Microsoft's fancy language. Definitely a nice language, but making everything
work with Linux and non-Visual Studio (Code) editors is not that easy.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
  (use-package csharp-mode

** Debug

Emacs already provides a large number of debuggers, under the name "Grand
Unified Debugger".

*** Dape

For a more recent and, in some settings, featureful debugging experience, there
is the DAP protocol, playing the same role than LSP for the programming
experience (auto-completion, jump-to definition/reference, etc).

The general protocol exists independently from Emacs, and we therefore have to
choose a client for it, just as we do with LSP. We choose ~dape~, which is the
"closest to built-in" compared to the alternative ~dap-mode~ (same difference than
in ~eglot~ vs ~lsp-mode~).

** Other tools
*** ANTLR
[[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANTLR][ANTLR]] is a tool that is used to write compilers and interpreters, by producing a
lexer and a parser (and potentially several other things) from a grammar.

*** SageMath

[[https://www.sagemath.org/][SageMath]] (or simply ~Sage~) is a general-purpose mathematics system, built-on top
of many other open-source softwares, that are combined and made accessible from
a common Python interface.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sage-shell-mode

*** Graphviz

Graphviz is a simple tool to visualize graphs. It used a custom file format,
usually withe extension ~.dot~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package graphviz-dot-mode
    :mode ("\\.dot\\'" . graphviz-dot-mode)
    :init

#+end_src

*** Tree-sitter

[[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][Tree-sitter]] is a "parser generator tool and an incremental parser library". One
of its uses is to enable any tool, such as a text editor, to use it for syntax
highlighting and structural code navigation, by delegating it the hard task of
parsing the source code. Although Emacs already has an extensive list of
languages for which a major-mode exists, both built-in and as external packages,
tree-sitter can be used on top of them to have faster, and more precise (not
based on regular expressions) highlighting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package treesit
    :defer t
    :ensure nil
    :custom
    (treesit-font-lock-level 4))
#+end_src

As a way to automatically change the major modes, without having to fiddle with
~auto-mode-alist~ and similar variables, we can use an alist which is looked up
anytime you open a file. Sadly, this only remaps major modes, not the hooks
or keymaps attached to them and so on, so there is still some manual fixes to
do.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :config
    (dolist (mode-remap '((c-mode . c-ts-mode)
                          (c++-mode . c++-ts-mode)
                          (sh-mode . bash-ts-mode)
                          (python-mode . python-ts-mode)))
      (add-to-list 'major-mode-remap-alist mode-remap nil 'equal)))
#+end_src

* Org Mode

   [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is one of the best reasons to use Emacs.

   It acts as a markup language, can deal with planning, manage spreadsheets, do
   project planning, run code blocks to do literate programming ...

** Fast LaTeX-preview: custom branch

*MANUAL* We do something that I do not usually do, which is installing a package
straight from an online repo outside of MELPA/ELPA & co. This is because there
is a new feature improving drastically LaTeX previews in Org files (and possibly
elsewhere), that we want to try before it gets merged upstream. We also modify
the ~:load-path~ of Org, to point to our newly installed version of Org rather
than the built-in one. Follow the instruction given [[https://abode.karthinks.com/org-latex-preview/][here]] and in particular
delete the ~.eln~ and ~.elc files associated with Org.

** Org Babel and blocks

Org babel is what allows us to write code and execute it, all within the same
document. More generally, Org has a notion of structured "block", with various
templates, serving various purposes (code snippets in programming languages,
quotations, examples ...).

We also add templates to insert code blocks with a few key presses.

Org-mode can export an ~.org~ document to various other formats, for example
\(\LaTeX\), ~.odt~ or ~HTML~. There are a lot of options for those different backends,
and you can even define your own backends easily.

*** HTML

**** Abbreviations

A useful feature, offered by some static website generators (e.g. [[https://getpelican.com/][Pelican]] ...),
consists in defining some "abbreviations" along with a description, all
occurrences of which being replaced in the exported document by a HTML ~abbr~
element. This is a built-in feature of Org-mode, but is easily added, using
~org-export-before-parsing-hook~, regular expressions tricks, and the
alread-existing Org parsing capabilities.

  An abbreviation is a cons cell (SHORT . LONG-DESCRIPTION), both
  SHORT and LONG-DESCRIPTION being strings.

  HTML element.

  SHORT needs not be a single word, but will only be matched at
  word boundaries (so for example, if SHORT is \"some text\", it
  will not be matched in \"My awesome text !\")

  SHORT can also be a regular expression.

  If an abbreviation is defined in a file and is also present in
  this list, the local version supersedes the global one.

  The matches are case-sensitive. To perform case-insensitive
  replacement, set `case-fold-search' to `t'.")

  with one abbreviation per line. In the buffer, occurrences of the
  abbreviated texts are matched using a simple regexp search, see
  `lps/org-export-abbr-global-abbrevs' for a full description.

  For parsing reasons, LONG-DESCRIPTION should not contain the

**** Anchors names

By default, Org exports automatically generated section names for healines,
section and so on. This means in particular that the generated IDs are modified
each time the file is re-exported, and that it is also meaningless. This code
tries to fix it, by generating IDs depending on the current section, possibly
using sections higher up in the tree until the ID is unique. The code is taken,
and might be adapted, from [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el?tab=readme-ov-file#export-to-html-with-useful-anchors][Alphapapa's list of unpackaged but still useful
functions]].

** Org Agenda

Not only is Org Mode great to write structured documents that can be exported to
pretty much anything we want - including tangled to produce source code using
literate programming -, it is also a powerful to ... *org*anize things. A
built-in functionality is the agenda, where you can schedule tasks, set
deadlines, configure reminders, the frequency at which you will need to repeat a
given task, and so on.

*** Integration with CalDAV

There exist several tools to sync remote calendars (from Google calendar, ADE,
some webmails' calendars, Outlook ...) to a local copy in ~.ics~ format. However,
we need an extra processing step before ~org-agenda~ can display them in its usual
agenda buffer. For this, we use an other command-line software, [[https://github.com/pimutils/khal][Khal]], which will
do all the hard-work for us and print the required information. In order to
integrate everything together, we use an Emacs package.

Note: when adding a calendar, you need to (at least when you use ~vdirsyncer~ and ~khal~):
- Configure it for ~vdirsyncer~, usually done in the =~/.config/vdirsyncer/config=
  file.
- Run ~vdirsyncer discover~ after that
- Configure ~khal~, usually in the =~/.config/khal/config= file
- Run ~khalel-import-events~ in Emacs to make the events of the new calendar
  available to Org agenda.

To improve this note-taking system, we would like to be able to visualize the
graph produced by all (or a part of) our notes. By default, ~org-roam~ is able
to use ~graphviz~ to produce such a visual plotting, but other methods exist,
and produce objects with which we can interact.

*** PDF modification

Sometimes, we don't only want to view PDF, but also to modify them, for example
split, concatenate, extract pages ... or add a table of contents.

Once again, we rely on external CLI tools and some wrapper Emacs package that
make using those tools easier.

*MANUAL* As explained on [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/doc-tools-toc][the package webpage]], you need to install some utilities:
~pdftotext~ from poppler-utils, ~pdfoutline~ from fntsample, and ~tesseract~
(sometimes packages as ~tesseract-ocr~).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package doc-toc
    :after pdf-tools
    :bind
    (:map pdf-view-mode-map
          ("C-c C-e" . doc-toc-extract-pages)
          ("C-c M-e" . doc-toc-extract-pages-ocr))
    :config
    ;; Mandatory as the package is poorly-written ...
    (define-key pdf-view-mode-map (kbd "C-c e") nil))
#+end_src

*** LaTeX

It is also possible to configure Emacs to comfortably write and edit LaTeX
documents, using the famous tool AUCTeX.

location where AucTeX will look it.

not necessarily defined when *tangling* ...)

I often download articles from the Internet: in that setting, as I do not use
browser extensions of separate software to manage my bibliography, the
quick-and-dirty solution is to copy the BibTeX citation from the Internet too,
and then using ~org-capture~, insert it at the right place, and link it to the
downloaded PDF file /via/ the usual ~org-ref-*~ tools.

Instead of recompiling the source code to generate a complete PDF to visualize
/e..g/ our mathematical formulas, AUCTeX also gives us the possibility to preview
them inlines (as well as other - configurables - constructs, such as figures,
matrices, and so on).

**** Fast input

AucTeX already includes a lot of shortcuts and ways to be more efficient when
typing LaTeX source code, /e.g./ with ~LaTeX-math-mode~ or the various environments
and sections that can be quickly entered. Some packages make this even faster.

Another thing that is painful when writing LaTeX is dealing with tables.
Thankfully, some packages try to alleviate this, and make editing several kind
of table-like environments easier.

Although I tend to use Org syntax whenever possible, it is sometimes convenient
to be able to edit Markdown files (typically, when interacting with other people
who might not be aware of Org's better syntax !)

detection of bash files, configuration of bash highlighting and so on.

*** VTerm

This section configures [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][VTerm]], a "fully-fledged terminal emulator" inside Emacs.
Eshell is especially nice for its integration, and some tools (such as
redirection to buffers, or easy elisp-scripting within commands), but sometimes
we need a generic terminal, compatible with usual CLI tools/shell commands.

** Eshell
*** General configuration

Contrary to ~term~ and ~shell~ (respectively invoked by =M-x <term/shell>=), [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][eshell]] is
not /emulating/ anything: it is, on its own, a shell-like command interpreter
implemented in Emacs Lisp. As such, it provides (most of) the usual commands
such as ~grep~, ~ls~ and so on, as well as an extra binding to Emacs (for example,
you can redirect the output of any command to an Emacs buffer). For this reason,
you can use ~eshell~ on any system that is able to run Emacs, as there is no
external dependency.

In fact, some of those commands are reimplemented in Emacs Lisp (/e.g./ ~cat~), some
of them are using the Emacs tools (for example ~grep~), and unknown commands are
passed to the /real/ commandline.

A more in-depth guide can be found [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell][here]].

We install a few packages which make eshell easier to use.

*** Bash/Fish completion
We use two packages to have a more powerful completion system in ~eshell~. The UI
is akin to the one used by vanilla Emacs - it opens another buffer whenever you
try to complete and there are more than one candidates - but it is still usable.

*MANUAL* The second package, =fish-completion=, needs ~fish~ to be installed on the
 system (and that a ~fish~ executable can be found on the path).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (system-case
   (gnu/linux
    (use-package fish-completion
      :defer t
      :hook (eshell-mode . lps/start-fish-completion)
      :config
      (defun lps/start-fish-completion ()
        (when (executable-find "fish")
          (setq-local company-backends '(company-capf))
          (define-key eshell-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'company-manual-begin)
          (fish-completion-mode 1)
          (setq fish-completion-fallback-on-bash-p t))))))
#+end_src

*** Aliases and commands
**** Aliases from .bashrc
*MANUAL* One thing that we might want to do is to be able to use aliases defined
in =.bashrc= in ~eshell~. There are [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EshellAlias][several solutions]] to this problem, and the one I
use only allows us to use bash aliases in ~eshell~ and not the contrary, for
example.

We can do this by adding the following line at the end of the =.bashrc= file:

#+begin_src sh
  alias | sed -E "s/^alias ([^=]+)='(.*)'$/alias \1 \2 \$*/g; s/'\\\''/'/g;" >~/.emacs.d/eshell/alias
#+end_src

It will simply go through the =.bashrc= file whenever you open a bash terminal,
and each time it sees a line starting with ~alias~, it will generate the
corresponding alias in an appropriate syntax and put it in the =eshell/alias= file
where ~eshell~ reads its aliases. This is not a very convincing solution for a few
reasons, the main ones being that this process is executed "from the bash side"
(and so requires us to start a bash shell or to at least execute the =.bashrc=
file), and that it overrides the =eshell/alias= file each time.

Another solution is to parse the aliases each time we start ~eshell~. We do this
by reading the =.bashrc= file and extracting the aliases.

Dired can also be used to search for files, using their names or their content.
Because those are useful functions, we bind them globally.

*** Dirvish

[[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/][Dirvish]] is (almost) a drop-in replacement for Dired. As it is essentially a big
wrapper around the built-in Dired, most of the customizations (bindings, some
defaults ...) are kept ! However, you may find that some of your old
customizations have become unneeded, for Dirvish provides more options, or
already has the "good" default behaviour, and so on.

*MANUAL* To enable all the options provided by Dirvish, you need to install the =fd=
and =mediainfo= command-line tools.

** TRAMP

editing package for Emacs". This is a bit misleading, as TRAMP is also used to
execute commands as another user, for example. It is quite heavily customizable.
However, I do not use it that much, and I am just defining a function here to
help me remember the easy-to-forget syntax.

** Dotfiles
In the \*nix world, We call /dotfiles/ files that are used to configure
software, applications or packages (they are generally /hidden/ files, whose
names start with a dot, hence the name). Various conventions are used in those
files, specifying similar but not identical DSL to configure each software, and
Emacs might have trouble choosing the right config by itself. In this section,
we try to improve the general look & fell of those dotfiles.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package conf-mode
    :hook
    (conf-mode . rainbow-mode))
#+end_src

** Tools
*** Disk usage
Although ~Dired~ is a powerful tool, it still lacks a neat feature, namely, it
doesn't show the /recursive/ size of the folders. We can usually do one of two
things: either write a lot of Elisp to include this into ~Dired~ (and risk
breaking things), or use a shell and functions such as ~du~. We choose a third
way, which consists in using a standalone package doing exactly what we want,
with extra functionalities, such as interactive sorting and filtering, deletion
of files, and so on, all within the same buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package disk-usage
    :defer t
    :bind
    (:map lps/system-tools-map
          ("d" . disk-usage)))
#+end_src

*** Processes

There are two usual ways to interact with processes via Emacs. The first one is
~proced~, which lists all the processes running on the system, and the other is
~list-processes~, which only lists subprocesses ran by Emacs (such as a PDF
server, a mail indexer, and so on)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package proced
    :ensure nil
    :only-built-in t
    :bind
    (:map lps/system-tools-map
          ("p p" . proced))
    (:map proced-mode-map
          ("a" . proced-toggle-auto-update))
    :custom
    (proced-goal-attribute nil)
    (proced-format 'medium)
    :config
    ;; Bug when sorting by pcpu (CPU usage): uses the string "%CPU" in
    ;; the mode-line, but %C is a control char, so it prints the current
    ;; column number rather than the literal %C !
    (ensure-emacs-version 29.1
      (setq proced-enable-color-flag t))

    ;; Small bug in French version of %b: does not produce
    ;; 6 characters-long time string for processes started earlier
    ;; in the same year
    (defun-override lps/proced-format-start (start)
      "Format time START.
  The return string is always 6 characters wide."
      (let ((d-start (decode-time start))
            (d-current (decode-time))
            (colon (if proced-enable-color-flag
                       (propertize ":" 'font-lock-face 'proced-time-colon)
                     ":")))
        (cond (;; process started in previous years
               (< (decoded-time-year d-start) (decoded-time-year d-current))
               (format-time-string "  %Y" start))
              ;; process started today
              ((and (= (decoded-time-day d-start) (decoded-time-day d-current))
                    (= (decoded-time-month d-start) (decoded-time-month d-current)))
               (string-replace ":" colon (format-time-string " %H:%M" start)))
              (t ;; process started this year
               (format-time-string " %e/%m" start))))))

  (use-package emacs
    :ensure nil
    :bind
    (:map lps/system-tools-map
          ("p l" . list-processes)))
#+end_src

*** Systemd

I am personally not completely opposed to using systemd. Therefore, I sometimes
need to edit or work with systemd services.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package systemd
    :defer t)
#+end_src

*** Printer

Printing things on Linux can be cumbersome. Most desktop environments (GNOME,
KDE ...) will provide some kind of wrappers around the default utilities, but
they are often only available for the corresponding applications (meaning that
you might have trouble printing stuff from /outside/ applications provided by
the DE). On the other hand, Emacs tries, but somewhat unsuccessfully, to give
some kind of abstraction over the printing process. We go an extra step further
and also use a package that improves the UI for printing stuff, using
~transient~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package transient-extras-lp
    :after pdf-tools
    :bind
    (:map lps/system-tools-map
          ("i" . transient-extras-lp-menu))
    (:map pdf-view-mode-map
          ("i i" . transient-extras-lp-menu)))
#+end_src

*** Docker

We use a wrapper around common ~docker~ commands, to easily deal with several
running containers, inspect them, stop/restart them, look-up files in the images
... without having to remember multiple complex commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package docker
    :bind
    (:map lps/system-tools-map
          ("D" . docker))
    :custom
    (docker-run-async-with-buffer-function 'docker-run-async-with-buffer-vterm)
    :config
    (require 'vterm))
#+end_src

*** Emacs Everywhere

Being used to write any kind of text into Emacs, it is probably easier to do so
/everywhere/ ! We use the following package, implemented in Elisp (and so, not
requiring to install any external tool besides the dependencies), to be able to
use Emacs to fill any text field in any application.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs-everywhere
    :defer t
    :custom
    ;; Disambiguate name for i3 window management, increase initial size
    (emacs-everywhere-frame-parameters `((name . "emacs-everywhere-init")
                                         (width . 100)
                                         (height . 20)))
    ;; Don't insert selection/spellcheck initially: we only write text
    (emacs-everywhere-init-hooks '(emacs-everywhere-set-frame-name
                                   ;; emacs-everywhere-set-frame-position ; don't override WM settings
                                   emacs-everywhere-apply-major-mode))
    :config
    ;; Try to robustify against content loss: bugs, etc
    (defvar emacs-everywhere-last-texts-ring (make-ring 10)
      "Last texts copied by `emacs-everywhere'")

    (defun emacs-everywhere-save-last-text ()
      (ring-insert
       emacs-everywhere-last-texts-ring
       (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max))))

    (defun emacs-everywhere-insert-last-text ()
      (interactive)
      (if (ring-empty-p emacs-everywhere-last-texts-ring)
          (message "Empty ring")
        (insert (ring-ref emacs-everywhere-last-texts-ring 0))))

    (define-key emacs-everywhere-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-y") 'emacs-everywhere-insert-last-text)

    (add-hook 'emacs-everywhere-final-hooks 'emacs-everywhere-save-last-text))

** mbsync

We already configured Emacs to be our main Git client, and to be a PDF Viewer.
We can go one step further, and use Emacs as a mail client.

There are already built-in tools to do this, for example
[[https://www.gnus.org/][Gnus]]. However, they tend to be slow, and there are
better alternatives. The one we use is combines several tools.

First of all, ~mbsync~. It synchronizes a local database to a distant one. It
can be configured using the =~/.mbsyncrc= file. It is an alternative to
~offlineimap~, which is apparently slower and tends to crash a bit more.

*MANUAL* ~mbsync~ needs to be installed separately. It might be available in the
~isync~ package.

** mu4e

The actual mail client that we use is a frontend to =mu=, called [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/tree/master/mu4e][mu4e]]. Depending
on your Linux distribution, you might encounter some troubles with the following
code, as the syntax might have changed between the versions and I might have
modified internal functions that no longer exist (or do not yet exist in your
version !).

*MANUAL* You need to install ~mu4e~ separately, either from the standard
repositories of your distribution or directly from source. Once installed, you
will need to execute a few commands to initialize everything, so please refer to
the package documentation.

*** Integrate with other Emacs tools
**** Attachments from Dired
One point that is a bit infuriating with the current state of ~mu4e~ is how you
are supposed to manage attachments. In particular, you have to navigate in a
whole filetree, everytime you want to attach a file. To my knowledge, there is
no "easy and immediate" way to /e.g./ attach several files at once.

To patch this, we use a few tricks with ~gnus-dired~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package gnus-dired

      "Return a list of active message buffers."

            (when (and (derived-mode-p 'message-mode)
                       (null message-sent-message-via))
              (push (buffer-name buffer) buffers))))
        (nreverse buffers)))

    (setq gnus-dired-mail-mode 'mu4e-user-agent))

  (use-package dired

**** Org MIME

~mu4e~ in itself is not really able to send HTML e-mails. However, it is nowadays
a given that people you are sending e-mails too are going to be able to
visualize HTML-ized content, and they might even /assume/ that this is the case -
meaning that a plain text e-mail will loo strange and/or unprofessional.

To deal with this problem, we use a ~org~ package, called [[https://github.com/org-mime/org-mime][Org MIME]], which uses the
MIME protocol to encode the content of our email. Moreover, it allows us to
write e-mails with the full power of ~org-mode~'s syntax and editing tools, and
directly export them in HTML.

**** Org agenda

Sometimes, people send calendar invitations via Email. Most of the time, this
means that there is a =text/calendar= attachment to the message, and luckily, Gnus
already knows how to deal with them ! It can also be integrated with org-agenda;
however, I find this integration a bit lacking, and override some of the
built-in functions.

** Other improvements

This section is dedicated to minor improvements to the mailing workflow. For
example, a thing that is often embarassing is sending a mail without its
attachment. We try to prevent this by having a package scan the content of the
message, and if it finds evidence of an absent attachment, it will gently remind
us.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package message-attachment-reminder
    :after mu4e
    :custom
    (message-attachment-reminder-regexp
     (regexp-opt '(;; English
                   "attached"
                   "attachment"
                   "enclosed"
                   ;; French
                   "ci-joint"
                   "pièce-jointe"
                   "t'envoie"
                   "vous envoie"))))
#+end_src

We also marginally improve the way raw email look, just in case we ever need to
look at those directly.

#+NAME: mu4e-raw-view
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (font-lock-add-keywords 'mu4e-raw-view-mode

* Reading and writing

Emacs is, obviously, quite good at dealing with text. Hence, it is natural to
wonder whether there are packages conceived to make reading (or writing !) books
or long articles more pleasant. Indeed, there are !

  (use-package olivetti
    :defer t
    :custom
    (olivetti-body-width 0.4)

#+end_src

In fact, we can even read EPUB files with Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package nov
    :defer t
    :init
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.epub\\'" . nov-mode))
    :custom
    (nov-variable-pitch t)
    (nov-text-width t)
    :config
    (defun lps/nov-mode-comfort-settings ()
      (setq visual-fill-column-width 90)
      (setq visual-fill-column-center-text t)
      (visual-line-mode 1)

** Spelling

      "Check the spelling of a mail message or news post.
  Don't check spelling of message headers except the Subject field.
  Don't check included messages.

  To abort spell checking of a message region and send the message anyway,
  use the `x' command.  (Any subsequent regions will be checked.)
  The `X' command aborts sending the message so that you can edit the buffer.

  To spell-check whenever a message is sent, include the appropriate lines
  in your init file:
     (add-hook \\='message-send-hook #\\='ispell-message)  ;; GNUS 5
     (add-hook \\='news-inews-hook #\\='ispell-message)    ;; GNUS 4

using the mouse or even the keyboard.

Moreover, it is sometimes useful to see a full-fledged, full-screen, complete
calendar. For this, we use Calfw, a "calendar framework for Emacs". It is less
useful than ~org-agenda~ for integrating with Org-mode (priorities, TODOs, tags
and so on), but is a very nice frontend/visualisation tool.

In particular, it integrates somewhat nicely with ~org-agenda~: it can read the
content of the agenda, using internally ~org-agenda-get-day-entries~, and so any
modification done to ~org-agenda~ "sources" will appear in Calfw. For example,
enabling the diary in Org /will/ show the diary entries (holidays, etc ...) in
Calfw.

Although not been updated in the last 7 years at the time of writing (2024), it
is still quite featureful and stable, and does not have that many bugs -
moreover, it is quite well documented, and any break can probably be fixed by an
Emacs user.

* News and RSS feed
** Elfeed

Because it is text-oriented, Emacs is a completely viable option to be a RSS
feed reader. Indeed, it can display, search, filter ... all the different
information that you can expect when using RSS feeds, but you also have the
whole power of Emacs to configure everything according to your need, /e.g./
infinite flexibility for search filters, bookmarks and so on.

We might also need to edit, fix, add or even write subtitles. Even without even
linking Emacs and MPV, subtitle files are often not perfect, and either contain
typos, poor translations, or are simply off-sync, and we use Emacs to edit them
as we would with any other text-based format.

* Various Fixes

This section contains a list of code snippets, which should hopefully be
temporary: they are patches/bug fixes of different packages, and do not add
functionality or provide simpler interface or whatever. Ideally, eveerything
here should eventually be deleted: check regularly to see if the fix has been
applied upstream.

* TODO Things to do or to fix
** Elfeed
- Find a neat way to have bookmarks/pre-configured filters.
- Have a split window like mu4e when browsing feed (need to change ~elfeed-show-entry-switch~)
- Fix dashboard for newer mu4e versions !
** Biblio
- Fix auto titles/key in biblio: ~org-ref-title-case~ and
  ~org-ref-lower-case-words~, ~bibtex-autokey-titlewords~ and
  ~bibtex-autokey-titleword-ignore~, and my own variable
  ~lps/do-not-capitalize-list~
- Add a way to "tag" bibtex entries. Likely a decent solution: add a TAGS field
  to entries, as a list of coma-separated tags.
  - Add function to add/remove tag
  - Add function to search only articles of a given tag (or tag combination ?)
  - Maybe change bibtex-format-entry functions to show tags (more or less
    succintly ?)
- Fix ~bibtex-autokey-demangle-name~ so that it correctly handles "long names":
  it currently assumes that a long name is of the form 'particle +
  relevant-stuff', while there might be surnames with a space where everything
  is to be kept.
- Try ~consult-bibtex~ ?

** Generic
Use functions that have been added to Emacs rather than mine, or use a macro to
decide according to the version:
- [ ] duplicate-dwim (29.1)
- [ ] rename-visited-file (29.1)
- [ ] Some maps defined by default repeat-mode
- [ ] restart-emacs (29.1)
- [ ] filename-parent-directory (29.1)

Fix other things:
- [ ] Keymaps: global/local-set-key changed to keymap-global/local-set (29.1)
- [ ] tangle emacs-config.org now asks for confirmation ?

To explore:
- [ ] replace-regexp-function
- [ ] defvar-keymap

** GPG
- [ ] Decide what to do with ~authinfo.gpg~ (might need system-wide orga)
  + [ ] If we keep using it: check ~epa-keys-select-method~

** Org mode
- [X] Fix (or check what breaks if fix) ~org-element-latex-fragment-parser~ so
  that it recognizes "dollars" followed by a dash directly (and no space+dash).
  - Solution: See [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html#LaTeX_Fragments][the Org syntax reference]] with additional syntax for LaTeX
- Add way to draw automata/trees easily without using artist mode (maybe TikZ
  integration ?)
- [X] Fix HTML files opening in Chrome sometimes (somewhat complicated. Some
  keywords: mailcap, sensible-browser, the /etc/mailcap file).
  - Solution: delete chrome.
- [ ] Improve ~expand-region~ in org-mode: it is very slow for the following reason:
  - Each function call (to try and mark an element) is wrapped by
    ~er--save-excursion~, which in ~org-mode~ simply calls ~er/save-org-mode-excursion~
  - This function in turns calls ~org-save-outline-visibility~
  - This is /very/ slow in large files: needs to traverse the entire file to
    collect folded region, and fold/unfold everything afterwards
  - This is probably useless: it /should/ be enough to save the state once, and
    restore it then, up to some edge-cases (region overlapping with a folded
    region, etc) which IMO should be "ignorable" in daily use.
  - For some reason though, wrapping the entire expansion phase in a unique
    ~er--save-excursion~ produces some artifacts (some headings get unfolded,
    can't explain why).
- Add a proper "personal org math mode" to typeset math, and setup/remove
  options (~org-cdlatex~, electric-pair twists, some protected blocks, etc).
- Maybe already done: add a way to jump /from/ the agenda /to/ a Cafw buffer
  (the other direction is already implemented, I believe) displaying "the same
  content" (if both directions are unimplemented: do them both ?)
- Improve colours of the displayed items in Calfw ? Maybe reuse
  ~org-agenda-category-icon-alist~, or other display code from the agenda ?
  Likely function to modify/variable to set:
  ~cfw:org-schedule-summary-transformer~.
- Add a way to export ~.ics~ invitations from =mu4e= to the agenda
  - Partially done in the file =gnus-icalendar=, e.g. see the function
    ~gnus-icalendar-sync-event-to-org~ and the variable
    ~gnus-icalendar-org-enabled-p~
- Check that the "useful IDs" generated in the HTML export also work in LaTeX
  exports (or any other, really), and fix it otherwise. Probably feasible using
  a toggle of the mode.
- Check that khalel/Khal integration works properly, and fix the apparent bug in
  org-capture integration
- [X] Org agenda: add hack (with some advices) to properly align the "tasks" to do
  in the agenda buffer. More precisely, the function ~org-agenda-format-item~
  calls the "breadcrumb-formatting" function ~org-format-outline-path~ with a
  maximal width of ~(1- (frame-width))~, while we would like to set it to the same
  value as the one that is used in the case of the *absence* of breadcrumbs,
  hardcoded in ~org-agenda-prefix-format~. To do that, we can add an advice around
  ~org-format-outline-path~, which sets the width to (?) depending on the value of
  some variable, dynamically set by some other advice around the ~format-item~
  function.
- [ ] Org agenda: try to hack ~org-agenda-get-timestamps~ to add a special "exclude
  date", or "end repeat" date, that makes it so that some repeated entries are
  not repeated absolutely unconditionnally (e.g., we know that the repetition
  ends at some point, or we want to mark some day as a special case where it
  should be ignored). NOT really needed: Diary expressions can process arbitrary
  code, they are just functions called on a given "day" returning NIL if the day
  is not matching (actually, the variable ~date~ is (lexically) set to the current
  date, in M/D/Y format).

** mu4e

- [ ] Add a way to download all (or at least some ?) attachments from multiple
  emails at once, from the ~mu4e~ headers buffer (this is useful /e.g./ when
  receiving multiple automatic mails).
- [X] Rewrite ~mu4e--view-handle-multi-urls~ (and some other probably, or maybe only
  ~mu4e--view-get-urls-num~) to prompt for URL with some info on the side (either
  the URL, the description text ...) rather than simply asking for a number !
  Idea for the UI : use ~mu4e-read-option~ ?
- [ ] Try to use =Supercite= to reply to mail (handles the "insert parent message
  into current reply" part of the reply) ? Might need quite a lot of
  customization though, and it is unclear if it is worth it.
- [ ] May be fix bookmark order when defined with ~mu4e-bookmark-define~ so that the
  original ones (from the ~defcustom~) appear first.
- [ ] Use a custom header field to add the "coloured" rectangle, rather than
  advising a bunch of stuff (see for example the ideas [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/50708][in this Emacs SE comment]])

** Printing
Not particularly Emacs-related, but: find a way to specify a username/password
to ~lp~ when printing using either the built-in functions or
~transient-extras-lp-*~

** PDF/LaTeX
*** Beamer

- Check if we can replace the hacks to fold frames by properly configuring
  ~TeX-fold-begin-end-spec-list~ or some similar options.

*** Documentation
- Improve the documentation function: jump to a manual depending on current
  packages (not word at point ...), /then/ look in index for word at point
  (using personal function ~lps/pdf-maybe-goto-index~), possibly streamlining
  the experience using a modified version of ~pdf-read-links-*~ if possible so
  that the word at point is automatically pre-selected and I only need to press
  enter if it is "automatically" found in the Index.
  - Also catch the potential call to latex2e documentation: open info manual
    instead of pdf.

** TRAMP

- Fix dirvish and sudoedit
- Use the new macro ~without-remote-files~ to startup faster without resorting to
  hacks.
- Make (S)FTP use ~auth-sources~. This is a recurring problem on the emacs-devel,
  and seems non-trivial, but I don't need something super robust myself. Likely
  idea: just query ~auth-source-search :host host :user user~ or something along
  those lines, and integrate the ~secrets~ API with ~auth-source~ itself. Possible
  code (to try & possibly fix:)
